README for the "pg" utility for Linux.

The "pg" utility is the historic System V equivalent to BSD's "more". This
is a free clone of it, and it is intended to conform to the SVID 4 as well
as the SUSv2 specification of this command.

Contrasting to the System V implementation, this one filters backspace
formatting sequences while searching, so you can comfortably search in nroff
output like manual pages.

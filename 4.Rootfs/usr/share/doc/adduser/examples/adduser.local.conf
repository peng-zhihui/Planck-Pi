# /etc/adduser.local.conf: Configuration for /usr/local/sbin/adduser.local #
############################################################################

# [JNZ] Modified 21-Jun-2013

# This file configures the local system additions to adduser(8) and should
# be modified to suit local conditions.
#
# adduser.local is a script that configures a user's account for various
# "services".  These services are simply convenient names for directories
# that must be created, Unix groups to which the user must be added, files
# that need to be copied and so on.
#
# Note that adduser(8) can now perform SOME of the tasks that adduser.local
# does, particularly by using the EXTRA_GROUPS and ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS
# variables in /etc/adduser.conf.  However, adduser.local is far more
# flexible than doing just that...
#
# Please see the end of this file for an explanation of its syntax.


######################
#   Global Options   #
######################

# The skelother variable points to the "other" (secondary) skeletal
# directory.  This directory is similar to /etc/skel (see the SKEL variable
# in /etc/adduser.conf), except that files are not necessarily copied to the
# home directory.

skelother = /etc/skel.other

# The dirmode variable specifies the octal mode used by chmod(1) for any
# directories created by adduser.local.  Note, however, that such created
# directories automatically inherit the SGID (set group ID) bit from their
# parent directory.

dirmode = 0755

# The filemode variable specifies the octal mode used by chmod(1) for any
# files created by adduser.local.

filemode = 0644


#####################
#   USERS service   #
#####################

# Add the user to the Unix group "users".  Every user on this machine
# should be a member of this group.  This is already done if the file
# /etc/adduser.conf includes the setting "USERGROUPS=no".  If USERGROUPS
# is set to "yes", you should uncomment the following three lines.

service = users
group[users] = users
addtogroup[users] = true


###################
#   WWW service   #
###################

# Configure the WWW service for the user, a service that has a real UID
# associated with it.  Assuming the user "www" has a GID of "www" and a
# home directory of "/home/www" (in actual fact, the values are taken from
# the password database), the following actions are performed:
#
#   - the user is added to the "www" group
#   - the directory "/home/www/doc/users/$USER" is created, owned by
#     the user, with group owner "www"
#   - the link "public_html" is created to point to this directory
#   - the file "/etc/skel.other/index.html" is copied to this directory
#
# This assumes that the system user "www" and group "www" are NOT the same
# as the UID and GID of the web server ("www-data" on my system).  The "www"
# account is for the web administrator.

service = www

mklink[www]     = true
linkname[www]   = "public_html"
skelfile[www]   = "index.html"
chgrpskel[www]  = true

# If your web server's configuration follows the "other" (more common!)
# standard for personal web pages (wherein the "public_html" directory is a
# real directory in the user's home directory), you might want to use
# something like the following:

#althome[www] = true
#mkdir[www] = true
#skelfile[www] = "index.html"

###########################
#   Syntax of this file   #
###########################

# The syntax of this file will be familiar to anyone who has used a
# scripting language before.  This file is processed line by line, with each
# line either being blank (and hence ignored), a comment or a configuration
# variable.
#
# Comment lines (such as this one) begin with a hash character ("#") and
# continue to the end of the line.  The hash character may be preceded by
# white space.  Comment lines, like blank lines, are ignored.
#
# All lines that are not blank or are comment lines contain configuration
# variables (one per line, with no comments allowed).  A configuration
# variable has one of two forms:
#
#     VARIABLE = VALUE
#     VARIABLE[SERVICE] = VALUE
#
# The first form is for global variables, while the second form is for
# variables associated with a particular service.  Both the variable name
# and the service name are alphanumeric strings and are case sensitive (ie,
# the names "SKELOTHER", "skelother" and "SkelOther" refer to three
# different variables).
#
# The value is typically a string which may or may not be case sensitive.
# It may be (but usually does not need to be) surrounded by single or double
# quotes, in which case everything within the quotes is part of the value.
# Note that white space may surround the variable, service and value
# components; such white space is discarded, unless it appears in quotes.
# You may NOT use backslash to quote quote characters!
#
# If a value required is a boolean, "0", "false", "f", "no" and "n" are
# treated as the false value, while "1", "true", "t", "yes" and "y" are
# treated as the true value.  In both cases, the value is case-insensitive.
#
#
# GLOBAL VARIABLES:
# =================
#
# The following global variables are available:
#
#     skelother
#     dirmode
#     filemode
#
# These are described in the section "Global Options" above.
#
#
# SERVICE VARIABLES:
# ==================
#
# The main role of adduser.local is to configure a user's account for
# various "services".  These services are simply convenient names for
# directories that must be created, Unix groups to which the user must be
# added, files that need to be copied and so on.
#
# adduser.local is informed of the existence of a service by the "service"
# global variable:
#
#     service = SERVICENAME
#
# The service name SERVICENAME may be any case-sensitive alphanumeric
# string.  Examples used within this file are "www" and "data".  Service
# names need not correspond to any real service --- they are completely
# internal to adduser.local, and are only used as a key for service
# variables.  The "service" global variable may appear multiple times, each
# time with a different service name.
#
# The order of the "service" global variables IS important, as that is the
# order in which those services are created.  This is important if one
# service depends on a prior one having been set up.
#
# The "service" global variable must appear before any of the services
# variables for that service are defined.
#
# The following service variables are available, and may be specified in any
# order:
#
#     user
#     group
#     addtogroup
#     homedir
#     subdir
#     althome
#     mounted
#     mkdir
#     chgrpdir
#     mklink
#     linkname
#     skelfile
#     chgrpskel
#
# Remember that each service variable is followed by a service name in
# square brackets.  In the following explanations, "SVC" is used as a
# sample service name.
#
#
# user[SVC] = USER
#
#     Specifies that the service belongs to a real user, and that that
#     service user name is USER.  This user name must appear in the password
#     database file either in the first field (ie, a user name) or in the
#     third (ie, a numeric UID).
#
#     Specifying a user name or UID also sets default values for the
#     "group" and "homedir" service variables.  These default values are
#     taken from the password database (the "homedir" variable is only set
#     if the "althome" variable is set to false).
#
#
# group[SVC] = GROUP
#
#     Specifies that the service's group name is GROUP.  This group name
#     must appear in the group database file either in the first field (ie,
#     a group name) or in the third (ie, a numeric GID).
#
#     If this variable is not specified, or is specified with GROUP as an
#     empty string "", and the user variable is specified (and points to a
#     valid user), the group name is taken to be the service user's default
#     group.  For example, if "user[svc] = mail" were to be specified, and
#     group[svc] were not, the group used would be default group for the
#     user "mail" (which happens to be GID 8, ie, "mail").
#
#     This group is also used for the group owner of directories, links
#     and copied files, depending on the settings of the "chgrpdir" and
#     "chgrpskel" variables.
#
#
# addtogroup[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Instructs whether to add the user to the group specified by the
#     "group" variable or implied by the "user" variable.  If true,
#     adduser.local adds the user to the group, assuming that the group,
#     in fact, exists.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.
#
#
# homedir[SVC] = PATH
#
#     Specifies the service's home directory as an absolute path name (ie,
#     starting from "/").  The service's home directory is used to check if
#     it is a mount point, as well as a base directory for the "mkdir" and
#     "skelfile" variables.  If the directory does not exist, those
#     variables take no effect.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, or is specified with PATH as an
#     empty string "", the value used for the service's home directory is
#     calculated in one of two ways.  The first method is to use the home
#     directory of the service user; the second is to use the home directory
#     of the user for whom adduser.local was called.
#
#     The first method is used when the "althome" variable is set to false
#     and the "user" variable is specified (and points to a valid user).
#     For example, if "user[svc] = www" and "althome[svc] = false" were to
#     be specified, the default value of the "homedir" variable would be
#     taken from www's home directory, typically "/var/www".
#
#     The second method is used when the "althome" variable is true.  For
#     example, if adduser.local were to be called for the user "anna", and
#     "althome" were set to true, the "homedir" variable would be set to the
#     home directory of anna, typically "/home/anna".
#
#     Note that neither of these methods is used if the "homedir" variable
#     is set to anything other than an empty string; in such a case, the
#     specified value for the variable is always used.
#
#
# subdir[SVC] = PATH
#
#     Specifies a subdirectory off the home directory.  This subdirectory is
#     used for creating the new directory, copying the skeleton file and for
#     the destination of the link.
#
#     If the "althome" variable is set to false, the subdirectory must
#     already exist and is used in conjunction with the home directory and
#     the user's name (for whom adduser.local was called).  For example, if
#     the following were to be specified:
#
#         homedir[svc] = /media/zip
#         subdir[svc] = home
#         althome[svc] = false
#         mkdir[svc] = true
#
#     and the user's name (for whom adduser.local was called) was "james",
#     the directory "/media/zip/home/james" would be created.
#
#     If, on the other hand, the "althome" variable was set to true, the
#     subdirectory is used only in conjunction with the home directory; it
#     is THAT directory that is created.  For example, if the following were
#     to be specified:
#
#         althome[svc] = true
#         subdir[svc] = "public_html"
#         mkdir[svc] = true
#
#     and adduser.local were called for the user "kathy" (who had the home
#     directory "/home/kathy"), the directory "/home/kathy/public_html"
#     would be created.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, blank is assumed.
#
#
# althome[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Specifies whether the default value for the "homedir" variable is to
#     be taken from the service's home directory or from the user's home
#     directory (for whom adduser.local was called).  If false, the
#     service's home directory (implied by the "user" setting) is used.  If
#     true, the actual user's home directory is used.
#
#     This variable also controls whether or not the user's login name is
#     used as part of the directory created by the "mkdir" variable and used
#     by the "mklink" and "skelfile" variables.  See "homedir" and "mklink"
#     for more details.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.
#
#
# mounted[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Specifies whether to check if the directory specified by the
#     "homedir" variable (or implied by other variables) is mounted or
#     not.  A directory is mounted if it, or any parent directory, is
#     mounted (excluding the root directory, which is always mounted).
#     For example, if the following were to be specified (and the user's
#     name were "alice"):
#
#         homedir[svc] = /home/external/server/ftp
#         subdir[svc] = doc/users
#         mounted[svc] = true
#         mkdir[svc] = true
#
#     then the directory "/home/external/server/ftp/doc/users/alice" would
#     be created only if either "/home/external/server/ftp",
#     "/home/external/server", "/home/external" or "/home" were mounted.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed (ie, the mount
#     check is NOT performed).
#
#     Note that "checking for mounting" is defined as examining the contents
#     of /proc/mounts.  It does NOT actually attempt to mount the
#     directories.
#
#
# mkdir[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Directs adduser.local whether or not to create the directory specified
#     by the "homedir" and "subdir" variables.  If the "althome" variable is
#     false, the directory that is created has the user's login name at the
#     end.  In all cases, the newly created directory belongs to that user.
#     For example, if adduser.local was called for the user "david", and the
#     following lines were to be specified:
#
#         homedir[data1] = "/data/1"
#         subdir[data1] = "users"
#         althome[data1] = false
#         mkdir[data1] = true
#
#     then the directory "/data/1/users/david" would be created, owned by
#     the user "david".  If, on the other hand, the following were to be
#     specified (for the same user "david"):
#
#         subdir[www] = "public_html"
#         althome[www] = true
#         mkdir[www] = true
#
#     then the directory "/home/david/public_html" would be created
#     (assuming "/home/david" was david's home directory), owned by the
#     user "david".
#
#     The mode of the directory is taken from the "dirmode" global variable
#     in this configuration file.  See also the comment on that global
#     variable.
#
#     The group owner of the directory is either the same as the user's (in
#     this case, if the user "david" was in the group "users" by default,
#     then the group owner would be "users"), or the same as the service
#     user's group (see the "group" variable for more information).  The
#     "chgrpdir" variable specifies which of these two options is used.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.
#
#
# chgrpdir[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Specifies the group owner of any directory and link created by the
#     "mkdir" and "mklink" variables respectively.  If true is specified,
#     the group owner is the same as specified by the "group" variable (or
#     implied by the "user" variable).  If false is specified, the group
#     owner is the same as the actual user's default group.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.
#
#
# mklink[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Specifies whether or not to create a symbolic link to the created
#     directory (see "mkdir" above) in the actual user's home directory.
#     The name of the link is taken from the "linkname" variable below.  For
#     example, if the following were to be specified, and adduser.local were
#     called for the user "mark":
#
#         homedir[data1] = "/data/1"
#         subdir[data1] = "users"
#         althome[data1] = false
#         mkdir[data1] = true
#         mklink[data1] = true
#         linkname[data1] = "data1"
#
#     then, not only would the directory "/data/1/users/mark" be created,
#     but the symbolic link "data1" would be created in his home directory
#     as well, pointing to that directory (that is, "/home/mark/data1" ->
#     "/data/1/users/mark").
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.
#
#
# linkname[SVC] = PATH
#
#     Specifies the name of the symbolic link created in the user's home
#     directory, as demonstrated in the example above.  If PATH includes
#     subdirectories, these subdirectories must already exist before the
#     symbolic link is created; these can be created by other services prior
#     to this one.
#
#     If the "mklink" variable is true, and the "linkname" variable is not
#     specified, or is an empty string "", the name of the service is used
#     (as specified by the "service" global variable).
#
#
# skelfile[SVC] = PATH
#
#     Instructs adduser.local to copy the file PATH from the "skelother"
#     skeleton directory (see the global variable of that name) into the
#     newly-created directory specified by the "mkdir" variable.  For
#     example, if adduser.local was called for the user "nina", and the
#     following lines were to be specified:
#
#         homedir[www] = "/home/www"
#         subdir[www] = "doc/users"
#         althome[www] = false
#         mkdir[www] = true
#         skelfile[www] = "index.html"
#
#     then the directory "/home/www/doc/users/nina" would be created and the
#     file "index.html" would be copied from /etc/skel.other (assuming this
#     is the directory specified by the "skelother" global variable) into
#     that newly-created directory.
#
#     The newly-copied file will have a mode as specified by the "filemode"
#     global variable, and its group owner will either be the default group
#     of the user, or the group as specified by the "group" variable or
#     implied by the "user" variable.  See the "chgrpskel" variable below.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, or PATH is an empty string "", no
#     file is copied.  If a file of that name already exists, it is NOT
#     overwritten.  Only one file may be specified in any given service; if
#     more are needed, simply create additional services with matching
#     "homedir", "subdir", "althome" and "mkdir" variables.
#
#
# chgrpskel[SVC] = BOOLEAN
#
#     Determines whether or not adduser.local changes the group owner of the
#     copied skeleton file (specified by the "skelfile" variable above) to
#     the group specified by the "group" variable or implied by the "user"
#     variable.  If this variable is false, the default group of the user
#     remains the group owner.
#
#     If this variable is not specified, false is assumed.

Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM.

NOTES:

How to use it is as follows:

      ./configure --help | less
      ./configure <your-options>
      make

To make sure everything was compiled correct, run:

      make check

If a test fails, you should not continue to install this build.
These tests require a suitable file /etc/pam.d/other; if necessary,
create such a file containing, e.g., these five lines (not indented)

	#%PAM-1.0
	auth	 required	pam_deny.so
	account	 required	pam_deny.so
	password required	pam_deny.so
	session	 required	pam_deny.so


Note, if you are worried - don't even think about doing the next line
(most Linux distributions already support PAM out of the box, so if
something goes wrong with installing the code from this version your
box may stop working..)

      make install

That said, please report problems to the bug reporting database
on sourceforge.net.

You can run additional checks after installing by executing

      make xtests

as root.

WARNING: Running "make xtests" can overwrite configuration data
or make the system insecure/unfunctional for a short time!
Backup all important data before!


If you do not wish to make the modules dynamically loadable, but
build a static libpam including all PAM modules, you have to call:

      ./configure --enable-static-modules --disable-pie

To run the build checks with static modules, you need to run the
following command: make -C test check && make check


To regenerate manual pages from the XML source files you need the
docbook-xsl stylesheets in version 1.69.1 or newer, older versions had
a bug which generates a broken layout.

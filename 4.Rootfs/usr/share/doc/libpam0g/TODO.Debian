- make pam_unix.so modules have some means of allowing other than root
  to auth users via unix_chkpwd (maybe unix_chkpwd needs a secure conf
  file?)
- Put in some of the Hurd related fixes
- Build-Depend-Indep on fop and install PDF docs, and add them to
  doc-base.  This depends on fop being patched to build using Java in
  main so it can move out of contrib.

Building with the diet libc
---------------------------

This package optionally can be built with the diet libc instead of the
glibc to provide small statically linked programs.  The resulting package
has no dependency on any other package.

To use the diet libc, make sure the latest versions of the dietlibc-dev
package is installed, and set DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=diet in the environment
when building the package, e.g.:

 # apt-get install dietlibc-dev
 $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=diet fakeroot apt-get source -b dash

# Use the sequences from en_US.UTF-8 as the basis:
include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"

#  Overriding U with caron:
<dead_caron> <u>                        : "ů"   U016F  #  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH RING ABOVE
<dead_caron> <U>                        : "Ů"   U016E  #  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH RING ABOVE

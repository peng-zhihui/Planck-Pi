# tell resolvconf about resolved's builtin DNS server, so that DNS servers
# picked up via networkd are respected when using resolvconf, and that software
# like Chrome that does not do NSS (libnss-resolve) still gets proper DNS
# resolution; do not remove the entry after stop though, as that leads to
# timeouts on shutdown via the resolvconf hooks (see LP: #1648068)

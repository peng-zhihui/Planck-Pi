# For standard directories the ldconfig call can be delayed, the dynamic
# linker will search the standard directories itself, which will incur a
# small performance penalty.
#
# For non-standard directories listed in /etc/ld.so.conf or in a file in
# /etc/ld.so.conf.d/, the call to ldconfig is essential and can not be
# skipped, otherwise libraries won't be found. Therefore declare ldconfig
# as interest-await.

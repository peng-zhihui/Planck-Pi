BPF Documentation
=================

This directory contains documentation for the BPF (Berkeley Packet
Filter) facility, with a focus on the extended BPF version (eBPF).

This kernel side documentation is still work in progress.  The main
textual documentation is (for historical reasons) described in
`Documentation/networking/filter.txt`_, which describe both classical
and extended BPF instruction-set.
The Cilium project also maintains a `BPF and XDP Reference Guide`_
that goes into great technical depth about the BPF Architecture.

The primary info for the bpf syscall is available in the `man-pages`_
for `bpf(2)`_.

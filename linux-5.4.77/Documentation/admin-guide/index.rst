The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide
=================================================

The following is a collection of user-oriented documents that have been
added to the kernel over time.  There is, as yet, little overall order or
organization here â€” this material was not written to be a single, coherent
document!  With luck things will improve quickly over time.

This initial section contains overall information, including the README
file describing the kernel as a whole, documentation on kernel parameters,
etc.

Here is a set of documents aimed at users who are trying to track down
problems and bugs in particular.

   ramoops
   dynamic-debug-howto
   init
   kdump/index
   perf/index

This is the beginning of a section with information of interest to

* Samsung Exynos Power Domains

Exynos processors include support for multiple power domains which are used
to gate power to one or more peripherals on the processor.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * samsung,exynos4210-pd - for exynos4210 type power domain.
    * samsung,exynos5433-pd - for exynos5433 type power domain.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- #power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier;
    must be 0.

Optional Properties:
- label: Human readable string with domain name. Will be visible in userspace
	to let user to distinguish between multiple domains in SoC.
- power-domains: phandle pointing to the parent power domain, for more details
		 see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt

Deprecated Properties:
- clocks
- clock-names

Node of a device using power domains must have a power-domains property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	lcd0: power-domain-lcd0 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10023C00 0x10>;
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		label = "LCD0";
	};

	mfc_pd: power-domain@10044060 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10044060 0x20>;
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		label = "MFC";
	};

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for description
of consumer-side bindings.

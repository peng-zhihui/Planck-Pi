* Renesas R-Car Timer Pulse Unit PWM Controller

Required Properties:

  - compatible: must contain one or more of the following:
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a73a4": for R8A73A4 (R-Mobile APE6) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7740": for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7743": for R8A7743 (RZ/G1M) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7744": for R8A7744 (RZ/G1N) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7745": for R8A7745 (RZ/G1E) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a7790": for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible PWM controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a77970": for R8A77970 (R-Car V3M) compatible PWM
			      controller.
    - "renesas,tpu-r8a77980": for R8A77980 (R-Car V3H) compatible PWM
			      controller.
    - "renesas,tpu": for the generic TPU PWM controller; this is a fallback for
		     the entries listed above.

  - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the PWM
    controller hardware module.

  - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
    PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.

Please refer to pwm.txt in this directory for details of the common PWM bindings
used by client devices.

Example: R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) TPU controller node

	tpu: pwm@e6600000 {
		compatible = "renesas,tpu-r8a7740", "renesas,tpu";
		reg = <0xe6600000 0x148>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};

* STMicroelectronics STM32 HASH

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
  HASH versions:
  - "st,stm32f456-hash" for stm32 F456.
  - "st,stm32f756-hash" for stm32 F756.
- reg: The address and length of the peripheral registers space
- interrupts: the interrupt specifier for the HASH
- clocks: The input clock of the HASH instance

Optional properties:
- resets: The input reset of the HASH instance
- dmas: DMA specifiers for the HASH. See the DMA client binding,
	 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: DMA request name. Should be "in" if a dma is present.
- dma-maxburst: Set number of maximum dma burst supported

Example:

hash1: hash@50060400 {
	compatible = "st,stm32f756-hash";
	reg = <0x50060400 0x400>;
	interrupts = <80>;
	clocks = <&rcc 0 STM32F7_AHB2_CLOCK(HASH)>;
	resets = <&rcc STM32F7_AHB2_RESET(HASH)>;
	dmas = <&dma2 7 2 0x400 0x0>;
	dma-names = "in";
	dma-maxburst = <0>;
};

CS42L51 audio CODEC

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs42l51"

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C.

Optional properties:
  - VL-supply, VD-supply, VA-supply, VAHP-supply: power supplies for the device,
    as covered in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

  - reset-gpios : GPIO specification for the reset pin. If specified, it will be
    deasserted before starting the communication with the codec.

  - clocks : a list of phandles + clock-specifiers, one for each entry in
    clock-names

  - clock-names : must contain "MCLK"

Example:

cs42l51: cs42l51@4a {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs42l51";
	reg = <0x4a>;
	clocks = <&mclk_prov>;
	clock-names = "MCLK";
	VL-supply = <&reg_audio>;
	VD-supply = <&reg_audio>;
	VA-supply = <&reg_audio>;
	VAHP-supply = <&reg_audio>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpiog 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};

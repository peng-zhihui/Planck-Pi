* Cadence PCIe endpoint controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "cdns,cdns-pcie-ep" to identify the IP used.
- reg: Should contain the controller register base address and AXI interface
  region base address respectively.
- reg-names: Must be "reg" and "mem" respectively.
- cdns,max-outbound-regions: Set to maximum number of outbound regions

Optional properties:
- max-functions: Maximum number of functions that can be configured (default 1).
- phys: From PHY bindings: List of Generic PHY phandles. One per lane if more
  than one in the list.  If only one PHY listed it must manage all lanes. 
- phy-names:  List of names to identify the PHY.

Example:

pcie@fc000000 {
	compatible = "cdns,cdns-pcie-ep";
	reg = <0x0 0xfc000000 0x0 0x01000000>,
	      <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
	reg-names = "reg", "mem";
	cdns,max-outbound-regions = <16>;
	max-functions = /bits/ 8 <8>;
	phys = <&ep_phy0 &ep_phy1>;
	phy-names = "pcie-lane0","pcie-lane1";
};

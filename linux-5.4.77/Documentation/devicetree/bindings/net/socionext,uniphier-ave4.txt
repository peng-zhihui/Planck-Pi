* Socionext AVE ethernet controller

This describes the devicetree bindings for AVE ethernet controller
implemented on Socionext UniPhier SoCs.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be
	- "socionext,uniphier-pro4-ave4" : for Pro4 SoC
	- "socionext,uniphier-pxs2-ave4" : for PXs2 SoC
	- "socionext,uniphier-ld11-ave4" : for LD11 SoC
	- "socionext,uniphier-ld20-ave4" : for LD20 SoC
	- "socionext,uniphier-pxs3-ave4" : for PXs3 SoC
 - reg: Address where registers are mapped and size of region.
 - interrupts: Should contain the MAC interrupt.
 - phy-mode: See ethernet.txt in the same directory. Allow to choose
	"rgmii", "rmii", "mii", or "internal" according to the PHY.
	The acceptable mode is SoC-dependent.
 - phy-handle: Should point to the external phy device.
	See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
 - clocks: A phandle to the clock for the MAC.
	For Pro4 SoC, that is "socionext,uniphier-pro4-ave4",
	another MAC clock, GIO bus clock and PHY clock are also required.
 - clock-names: Should contain
	- "ether", "ether-gb", "gio", "ether-phy" for Pro4 SoC
	- "ether" for others
 - resets: A phandle to the reset control for the MAC. For Pro4 SoC,
	GIO bus reset is also required.
 - reset-names: Should contain
	- "ether", "gio" for Pro4 SoC
	- "ether" for others
 - socionext,syscon-phy-mode: A phandle to syscon with one argument
	that configures phy mode. The argument is the ID of MAC instance.

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
defined in ethernet.txt.

Required subnode:
 - mdio: A container for child nodes representing phy nodes.
         See phy.txt in the same directory.

Example:

	ether: ethernet@65000000 {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-ld20-ave4";
		reg = <0x65000000 0x8500>;
		interrupts = <0 66 4>;
		phy-mode = "rgmii";
		phy-handle = <&ethphy>;
		clock-names = "ether";
		clocks = <&sys_clk 6>;
		reset-names = "ether";
		resets = <&sys_rst 6>;
		socionext,syscon-phy-mode = <&soc_glue 0>;
		local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];

		mdio {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			ethphy: ethphy@1 {
				reg = <1>;
			};
		};
	};

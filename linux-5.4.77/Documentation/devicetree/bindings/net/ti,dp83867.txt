* Texas Instruments - dp83867 Giga bit ethernet phy

Required properties:
	- reg - The ID number for the phy, usually a small integer
	- ti,rx-internal-delay - RGMII Receive Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
		PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID
	- ti,tx-internal-delay - RGMII Transmit Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
		PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID
	- ti,fifo-depth - Transmitt FIFO depth- see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values

Note: If the interface type is PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII the TX/RX clock delays
      will be left at their default values, as set by the PHY's pin strapping.
      The default strapping will use a delay of 2.00 ns.  Thus
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII, by default, does not behave as RGMII with no
      internal delay, but as PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.  The device tree
      should use "rgmii-id" if internal delays are desired as this may be
      changed in future to cause "rgmii" mode to disable delays.

Optional property:
	- ti,min-output-impedance - MAC Interface Impedance control to set
				    the programmable output impedance to
				    minimum value (35 ohms).
	- ti,max-output-impedance - MAC Interface Impedance control to set
				    the programmable output impedance to
				    maximum value (70 ohms).
	- ti,dp83867-rxctrl-strap-quirk - This denotes the fact that the
				    board has RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin strapped in
				    mode 1 or 2. To ensure PHY operation,
				    there are specific actions that
				    software needs to take when this pin is
				    strapped in these modes. See data manual
				    for details.
	- ti,clk-output-sel - Muxing option for CLK_OUT pin.  See dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
			      for applicable values.  The CLK_OUT pin can also
			      be disabled by this property.  When omitted, the
			      PHY's default will be left as is.
	- ti,sgmii-ref-clock-output-enable - This denotes which
				    SGMII configuration is used (4 or 6-wire modes).
				    Some MACs work with differential SGMII clock.
				    See data manual for details.

Note: ti,min-output-impedance and ti,max-output-impedance are mutually
      exclusive. When both properties are present ti,max-output-impedance
      takes precedence.

Default child nodes are standard Ethernet PHY device
nodes as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt

Example:

	ethernet-phy@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		ti,rx-internal-delay = <DP83867_RGMIIDCTL_2_25_NS>;
		ti,tx-internal-delay = <DP83867_RGMIIDCTL_2_75_NS>;
		ti,fifo-depth = <DP83867_PHYCR_FIFO_DEPTH_4_B_NIB>;
	};

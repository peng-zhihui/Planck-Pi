Generic CAN transceiver Device Tree binding
------------------------------

CAN transceiver typically limits the max speed in standard CAN and CAN FD
modes. Typically these limitations are static and the transceivers themselves
provide no way to detect this limitation at runtime. For this situation,
the "can-transceiver" node can be used.

Required Properties:
 max-bitrate:	a positive non 0 value that determines the max
		speed that CAN/CAN-FD can run. Any other value
		will be ignored.

Examples:

Based on Texas Instrument's TCAN1042HGV CAN Transceiver

m_can0 {
	....
	can-transceiver {
		max-bitrate = <5000000>;
	};
	...
};

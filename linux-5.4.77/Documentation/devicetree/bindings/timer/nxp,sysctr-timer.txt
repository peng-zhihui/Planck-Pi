NXP System Counter Module(sys_ctr)

The system counter(sys_ctr) is a programmable system counter which provides
a shared time base to Cortex A15, A7, A53, A73, etc. it is intended for use in
applications where the counter is always powered and support multiple,
unrelated clocks. The compare frame inside can be used for timer purpose.

Required properties:

- compatible :      should be "nxp,sysctr-timer"
- reg :             Specifies the base physical address and size of the comapre
                    frame and the counter control, read & compare.
- interrupts :      should be the first compare frames' interrupt
- clocks : 	    Specifies the counter clock.
- clock-names: 	    Specifies the clock's name of this module

Example:

	system_counter: timer@306a0000 {
		compatible = "nxp,sysctr-timer";
		reg = <0x306a0000 0x20000>;/* system-counter-rd & compare */
		clocks = <&clk_8m>;
		clock-names = "per";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 47 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

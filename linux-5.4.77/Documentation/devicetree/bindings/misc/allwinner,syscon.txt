* Allwinner sun8i system controller

This file describes the bindings for the system controller present in
Allwinner SoC H3, A83T and A64.
The principal function of this syscon is to control EMAC PHY choice and
config.

Required properties for the system controller:
- reg: address and length of the register for the device.
- compatible: should be "syscon" and one of the following string:
		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-system-controller"
		"allwinner,sun8i-v3s-system-controller"
		"allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-controller"
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-system-controller"

Example:
syscon: syscon@1c00000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-system-controller", "syscon";
	reg = <0x01c00000 0x1000>;
};

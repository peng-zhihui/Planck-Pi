== Introduction==

LLCC (Last Level Cache Controller) provides last level of cache memory in SOC,
that can be shared by multiple clients. Clients here are different cores in the
SOC, the idea is to minimize the local caches at the clients and migrate to
common pool of memory. Cache memory is divided into partitions called slices
which are assigned to clients. Clients can query the slice details, activate
and deactivate them.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,sdm845-llcc"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value Type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The first element specifies the llcc base start address and
		    the size of the register region. The second element specifies
		    the llcc broadcast base address and size of the register region.

- reg-names:
        Usage: required
        Value Type: <stringlist>
        Definition: Register region names. Must be "llcc_base", "llcc_broadcast_base".

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Definition: The interrupt is associated with the llcc edac device.
			It's used for llcc cache single and double bit error detection
			and reporting.

Example:

	cache-controller@1100000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-llcc";
		reg = <0x1100000 0x200000>, <0x1300000 0x50000> ;
		reg-names = "llcc_base", "llcc_broadcast_base";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 582 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

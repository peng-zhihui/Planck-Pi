Tianma Micro-electronics TM070RVHG71 7.0" WXGA TFT LCD panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "tianma,tm070rvhg71"
- power-supply: single regulator to provide the supply voltage
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel

Required nodes:
- port: LVDS port mapping to connect this display

This panel needs single power supply voltage. Its backlight is conntrolled
via PWM signal.

Example:

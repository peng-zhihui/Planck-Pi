Winstar Display Corporation 3.5" QVGA (320x240) TFT LCD panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "winstar,wf35ltiacd"
- power-supply: regulator to provide the VCC supply voltage (3.3 volts)

This binding is compatible with the simple-panel binding, which is specified
in simple-panel.txt in this directory.

Example:
	backlight: backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&hlcdc_pwm 0 50000 PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED>;
		brightness-levels = <0 31 63 95 127 159 191 223 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <191>;
		power-supply = <&bl_reg>;
	};

	bl_reg: backlight_regulator {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name = "backlight-power-supply";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
	};

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "winstar,wf35ltiacd", "simple-panel";
		backlight = <&backlight>;
		power-supply = <&panel_reg>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			panel_input: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&hlcdc_panel_output>;
			};
		};
	};

	panel_reg: panel_regulator {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name = "panel-power-supply";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
	};

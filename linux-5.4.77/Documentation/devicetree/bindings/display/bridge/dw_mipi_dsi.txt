Synopsys DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller
============================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI
DSI host controller. It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification
by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific device tree
bindings.

When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
responsible for defining whether each optional property is used or not.

- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DesignWare MIPI DSI
  host controller registers. (mandatory)

- clocks: References to all the clocks specified in the clock-names property
  as specified in [1]. (mandatory)

- clock-names:
  - "pclk" is the peripheral clock for either AHB and APB. (mandatory)
  - "px_clk" is the pixel clock for the DPI/RGB input. (optional)

- resets: References to all the resets specified in the reset-names property
  as specified in [2]. (optional)

- reset-names: string reset name, must be "apb" if used. (optional)

- panel or bridge node: see [3]. (mandatory)

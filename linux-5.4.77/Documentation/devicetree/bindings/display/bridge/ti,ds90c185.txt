Texas Instruments FPD-Link (LVDS) Serializer
--------------------------------------------

The DS90C185 and DS90C187 are low-power serializers for portable
battery-powered applications that reduces the size of the RGB
interface between the host GPU and the display.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be
  "ti,ds90c185", "lvds-encoder"  for the TI DS90C185 FPD-Link Serializer
  "ti,ds90c187", "lvds-encoder"  for the TI DS90C187 FPD-Link Serializer

Optional properties:

- powerdown-gpios: Power down control GPIO (the PDB pin, active-low)

Required nodes:

The devices have two video ports. Their connections are modeled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for parallel input
- Video port 1 for LVDS output


Example
-------

lvds-encoder {
	compatible = "ti,ds90c185", "lvds-encoder";

	powerdown-gpios = <&gpio 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			lvds_enc_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcdc_out_rgb>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			lvds_enc_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lvds_panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};
};

Description:
		Sends an FSI terminate command from the master to its
		connected slave. A terminate resets the slave's state machines
		that control access to the internally connected engines.  In
		addition the slave freezes its internal error register for
		debugging purposes.  This command is also needed to abort any
		ongoing operation in case of an expired 'Master Time Out'
		timer.

What:		/sys/class/power_supply/wilco-charger/charge_type
Date:		April 2019
KernelVersion:	5.2
Description:
		What charging algorithm to use:

		Standard: Fully charges battery at a standard rate.
		Adaptive: Battery settings adaptively optimized based on
			typical battery usage pattern.
		Fast: Battery charges over a shorter period.
		Trickle: Extends battery lifespan, intended for users who
			primarily use their Chromebook while connected to AC.
		Custom: A low and high threshold percentage is specified.
			Charging begins when level drops below
			charge_control_start_threshold, and ceases when
			level is above charge_control_end_threshold.

Description:

		Count mode for channel Y. Four count modes are available:
		normal, range limit, non-recycle, and modulo-n. The preset value
		for channel Y is used by the count mode where required.

		Normal:
			Counting is continuous in either direction.

		Range Limit:
			An upper or lower limit is set, mimicking limit switches
			in the mechanical counterpart. The upper limit is set to
			the preset value, while the lower limit is set to 0. The
			counter freezes at count = preset when counting up, and
			at count = 0 when counting down. At either of these
			limits, the counting is resumed only when the count
			direction is reversed.

		Non-recycle:
			Counter is disabled whenever a 24-bit count overflow or
			underflow takes place. The counter is re-enabled when a
			new count value is loaded to the counter via a preset
			operation or write to raw.

		Modulo-N:
			A count boundary is set between 0 and the preset value.
			The counter is reset to 0 at count = preset when
			counting up, while the counter is set to the preset
			value at count = 0 when counting down; the counter does
			not freeze at the bundary points, but counts
			continuously throughout.

KernelVersion:	4.10
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This interface is deprecated; please use the Counter subsystem.

		Configure channel Y counter for non-quadrature or quadrature
		clock mode. Selecting non-quadrature clock mode will disable
		synchronous load mode. In quadrature clock mode, the channel Y
		scale attribute selects the encoder phase division (scale of 1
		selects full-cycle, scale of 0.5 selects half-cycle, scale of
		0.25 selects quarter-cycle) processed by the channel Y counter.

		Non-quadrature:
			The filter and decoder circuit are bypassed. Encoder A
			input serves as the count input and B as the UP/DOWN
			direction control input, with B = 1 selecting UP Count
			mode and B = 0 selecting Down Count mode.

		Quadrature:
			Encoder A and B inputs are digitally filtered and
			decoded for UP/DN clock.

Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This interface is deprecated; please use the Counter subsystem.

		Configure channel Y counter for non-synchronous or synchronous
		load mode. Synchronous load mode cannot be selected in
		non-quadrature clock mode.

		Non-synchronous:
			A logic low level is the active level at this index
			input. The index function (as enabled via
			set_to_preset_on_index) is performed directly on the
			active level of the index input.

		Synchronous:
			Intended for interfacing with encoder Index output in
			quadrature clock mode. The active level is configured
			via index_polarity. The index function (as enabled via
			set_to_preset_on_index) is performed synchronously with
			the quadrature clock on the active level of the index
			input.

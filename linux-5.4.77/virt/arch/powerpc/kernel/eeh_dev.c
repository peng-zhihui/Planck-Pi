 * We have to support multiple situations where dynamic creation of EEH device
 * is required:
 *
 * 1) Before PCI emunation starts, we need create EEH devices according to the
 *    PCI sensitive OF nodes.
 * 2) When PCI emunation is done, we need do the binding between PCI device and
 *    the associated EEH device.
 * 3) DR (Dynamic Reconfiguration) would create PCI sensitive OF node. EEH device
 *    will be created while PCI sensitive OF node is detected from DR.
 * 4) PCI hotplug needs redoing the binding between PCI device and EEH device. If
 *    PHB is newly inserted, we also need create EEH devices accordingly.

	help
	  Use optimized AES assembler routines for ARM platforms.

	  On ARM processors without the Crypto Extensions, this is the
	  fastest AES implementation for single blocks.  For multiple
	  blocks, the NEON bit-sliced implementation is usually faster.

	  This implementation may be vulnerable to cache timing attacks,
	  since it uses lookup tables.  However, as countermeasures it
	  disables IRQs and preloads the tables; it is hoped this makes
	  such attacks very difficult.

	  Use a faster and more secure NEON based implementation of AES in CBC,
	  CTR and XTS modes

	  Bit sliced AES gives around 45% speedup on Cortex-A15 for CTR mode
	  and for XTS mode encryption, CBC and XTS mode decryption speedup is
	  around 25%. (CBC encryption speed is not affected by this driver.)
	  This implementation does not rely on any lookup tables so it is
	  believed to be invulnerable to cache timing attacks.

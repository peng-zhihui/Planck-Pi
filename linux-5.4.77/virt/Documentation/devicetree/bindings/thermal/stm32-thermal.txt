Binding for Thermal Sensor for STMicroelectronics STM32 series of SoCs.

On STM32 SoCs, the Digital Temperature Sensor (DTS) is in charge of managing an
analog block which delivers a frequency depending on the internal SoC's
temperature. By using a reference frequency, DTS is able to provide a sample
number which can be translated into a temperature by the user.

DTS provides interrupt notification mechanism by threshold. This mechanism
offers two temperature trip points: passive and critical. The first is intended
for passive cooling notification while the second is used for over-temperature
reset.

Required parameters:
-------------------

compatible: 	Should be "st,stm32-thermal"
reg: 		This should be the physical base address and length of the
		sensor's registers.
clocks: 	Phandle of the clock used by the thermal sensor.
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
clock-names: 	Should be "pclk" for register access clock and reference clock.
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
#thermal-sensor-cells: Should be 0. See ./thermal.txt for a description.
interrupts:	Standard way to define interrupt number.

Example:

	thermal-zones {
		cpu_thermal: cpu-thermal {
			polling-delay-passive = <0>;
			polling-delay = <0>;

			thermal-sensors = <&thermal>;

			trips {
				cpu_alert1: cpu-alert1 {
					temperature = <85000>;
					hysteresis = <0>;
					type = "passive";
				};

				cpu-crit: cpu-crit {
					temperature = <120000>;
					hysteresis = <0>;
					type = "critical";
				};
			};

			cooling-maps {
			};
		};
	};

	thermal: thermal@50028000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-thermal";
		reg = <0x50028000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&rcc TMPSENS>;
		clock-names = "pclk";
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 147 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

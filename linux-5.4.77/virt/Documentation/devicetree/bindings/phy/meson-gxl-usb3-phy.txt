* Amlogic Meson GXL and GXM USB3 PHY and OTG detection binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy"
- #phys-cells:	must be 0 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- interrupts:	the interrupt specifier for the OTG detection
- clocks:	phandles to the clocks for
		- the USB3 PHY
		- and peripheral mode/OTG detection
- clock-names:	must contain "phy" and "peripheral"
- resets:	phandle to the reset lines for:
		- the USB3 PHY and
		- peripheral mode/OTG detection
- reset-names:	must contain "phy" and "peripheral"

Optional properties:
- phy-supply:	see phy-bindings.txt in this directory


Example:
	usb3_phy0: phy@78080 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0x78080 0x0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_USB_OTG>, <&clkc_AO CLKID_AO_CEC_32K>;
		clock-names = "phy", "peripheral";
		resets = <&reset RESET_USB_OTG>, <&reset RESET_USB_OTG>;
		reset-names = "phy", "peripheral";
	};

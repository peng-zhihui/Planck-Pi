STMicroelectronics STM32 Low-Power Timer PWM

STM32 Low-Power Timer provides single channel PWM.

Must be a sub-node of an STM32 Low-Power Timer device tree node.
See ../mfd/stm32-lptimer.txt for details about the parent node.

Required parameters:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-pwm-lp".
- #pwm-cells:		Should be set to 3. This PWM chip uses the default 3 cells
			bindings defined in pwm.txt.

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default". An additional "sleep" state can be
			defined to set pins in sleep state when in low power.
- pinctrl-n: 		Phandle(s) pointing to pin configuration node for PWM,
			respectively for "default" and "sleep" states.

Example:
	timer@40002400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer";
		...
		pwm {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm-lp";
			#pwm-cells = <3>;
			pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
			pinctrl-0 = <&lppwm1_pins>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&lppwm1_sleep_pins>;
		};
	};

Regulator driver for MAX77650 PMIC from Maxim Integrated.

This module is part of the MAX77650 MFD device. For more details
see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/max77650.txt.

The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
on the device tree.

The device has a single LDO regulator and a SIMO buck-boost regulator with
three independent power rails.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Must be "maxim,max77650-regulator"

Each rail must be instantiated under the regulators subnode of the top PMIC
node. Up to four regulators can be defined. For standard regulator properties
refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Available regulator compatible strings are: "ldo", "sbb0", "sbb1", "sbb2".

Example:
--------

	regulators {
		compatible = "maxim,max77650-regulator";

		max77650_ldo: regulator@0 {
			regulator-compatible = "ldo";
			regulator-name = "max77650-ldo";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1350000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <2937500>;
		};

		max77650_sbb0: regulator@1 {
			regulator-compatible = "sbb0";
			regulator-name = "max77650-sbb0";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1587500>;
		};
	};

- reg : base physical address of the controller and length of memory mapped

- interrupts : interrupt number to the cpu.
- samsung,syscon-phandle : reference to syscon node (This property required only
	in case of compatible being "samsung,exynos5250-wdt" or "samsung,exynos5420-wdt".
	In case of Exynos5250 and 5420 this property points to syscon node holding the PMU
	base address)

	interrupts = <0 42 0>;
	clocks = <&clock 336>;
	clock-names = "watchdog";
	samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_syscon>;

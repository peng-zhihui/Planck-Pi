Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "qca,<soc>-eth". Currently support compatibles are:
		qca,ar7100-eth - Atheros AR7100
		qca,ar7240-eth - Atheros AR7240
		qca,ar7241-eth - Atheros AR7241
		qca,ar7242-eth - Atheros AR7242
		qca,ar9130-eth - Atheros AR9130
		qca,ar9330-eth - Atheros AR9330
		qca,ar9340-eth - Atheros AR9340
		qca,qca9530-eth - Qualcomm Atheros QCA9530
		qca,qca9550-eth - Qualcomm Atheros QCA9550
		qca,qca9560-eth - Qualcomm Atheros QCA9560

- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain eth interrupt
- phy-mode : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- clocks: the clock used by the core
- clock-names: the names of the clock listed in the clocks property. These are
	"eth" and "mdio".
- resets: Should contain phandles to the reset signals
- reset-names: Should contain the names of reset signal listed in the resets
		property. These are "mac" and "mdio"

Optional properties:
- phy-handle : phandle to the PHY device connected to this device.
- fixed-link : Assume a fixed link. See fixed-link.txt in the same directory.
  Use instead of phy-handle.

Optional subnodes:
- mdio : specifies the mdio bus, used as a container for phy nodes
  according to phy.txt in the same directory

Example:

ethernet@1a000000 {
	compatible = "qca,ar9330-eth";
	reg = <0x1a000000 0x200>;
	interrupts = <5>;
	resets = <&rst 13>, <&rst 23>;
	reset-names = "mac", "mdio";
	clocks = <&pll ATH79_CLK_AHB>, <&pll ATH79_CLK_MDIO>;
	clock-names = "eth", "mdio";

	phy-mode = "gmii";
};

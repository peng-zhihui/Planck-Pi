* Faraday Technology FTGMAC100 gigabit ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "faraday,ftgmac100"

  Must also contain one of these if used as part of an Aspeed AST2400
  or 2500 family SoC as they have some subtle tweaks to the
  implementation:

     - "aspeed,ast2400-mac"
     - "aspeed,ast2500-mac"

- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet controller interrupt

Optional properties:
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory. If the property is
  absent, "rgmii" is assumed. Supported values are "rgmii*" and "rmii" for
  aspeed parts. Other (unknown) parts will accept any value.
- use-ncsi: Use the NC-SI stack instead of an MDIO PHY. Currently assumes
  rmii (100bT) but kept as a separate property in case NC-SI grows support
  for a gigabit link.
- no-hw-checksum: Used to disable HW checksum support. Here for backward
  compatibility as the driver now should have correct defaults based on
  the SoC.

Example:

	mac0: ethernet@1e660000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-mac", "faraday,ftgmac100";
		reg = <0x1e660000 0x180>;
		interrupts = <2>;
		use-ncsi;
	};

* MediaTek mt76xx devices

This node provides properties for configuring the MediaTek mt76xx wireless
device. The node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI
controller to which the wireless chip is connected.

Alternatively, it can specify the wireless part of the MT7628/MT7688 SoC.
For SoC, use the compatible string "mediatek,mt7628-wmac" and the following
properties:

- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: Main device interrupt

Optional properties:

- ieee80211-freq-limit: See ieee80211.txt
- mediatek,mtd-eeprom: Specify a MTD partition + offset containing EEPROM data

The MAC address can as well be set with corresponding optional properties
defined in net/ethernet.txt.

Optional nodes:
- led: Properties for a connected LED
  Optional properties:
    - led-sources: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

			mediatek,mtd-eeprom = <&factory 0x8000>;

MT7628 example:

wmac: wmac@10300000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7628-wmac";
	reg = <0x10300000 0x100000>;

	interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
	interrupts = <6>;

	mediatek,mtd-eeprom = <&factory 0x0000>;
};

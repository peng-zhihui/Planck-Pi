STMicroelectronics STM32 Timer quadrature encoder

STM32 Timer provides quadrature encoder to detect
angular position and direction of rotary elements,
from IN1 and IN2 input signals.

Must be a sub-node of an STM32 Timer device tree node.
See ../mfd/stm32-timers.txt for details about the parent node.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-timer-counter".
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0: 		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes,
			to set CH1/CH2 pins in mode of operation for STM32
			Timer input on external pin.

Example:
	timers@40010000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "st,stm32-timers";
		reg = <0x40010000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 160>;
		clock-names = "int";

		counter {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer-counter";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_in_pins>;
		};
	};

Raydium RM67171 OLED LCD panel with MIPI-DSI protocol

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"raydium,rm67191"
- reg:			virtual channel for MIPI-DSI protocol
			must be <0>
- dsi-lanes:		number of DSI lanes to be used
			must be <3> or <4>
- port: 		input port node with endpoint definition as
			defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
			the input port should be connected to a MIPI-DSI device
			driver

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios:		a GPIO spec for the RST_B GPIO pin
- v3p3-supply:		phandle to 3.3V regulator that powers the VDD_3V3 pin
- v1p8-supply:		phandle to 1.8V regulator that powers the VDD_1V8 pin
- width-mm:		see panel-common.txt
- height-mm:		see panel-common.txt
- video-mode:		0 - burst-mode
			1 - non-burst with sync event
			2 - non-burst with sync pulse

Example:

	panel@0 {
		compatible = "raydium,rm67191";
		reg = <0>;
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mipi_dsi_0_1_en>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio1 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		dsi-lanes = <4>;
		width-mm = <68>;
		height-mm = <121>;

		port {
			panel_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_out>;
			};
		};
	};

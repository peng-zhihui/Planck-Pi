Kaohsiung Opto-Electronics Inc. 5.7" QVGA (320 x 240) TFT LCD panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "koe,tx14d24vm1bpa"
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
- power-supply: single regulator to provide the supply voltage

Required nodes:
- port: Parallel port mapping to connect this display

This panel needs single power supply voltage. Its backlight is conntrolled
via PWM signal.

Example:
--------

Example device-tree definition when connected to iMX53 based board

	lcd_panel: lcd-panel {
		compatible = "koe,tx14d24vm1bpa";
		backlight = <&backlight_lcd>;
		power-supply = <&reg_3v3>;

		port {
			lcd_panel_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcd_display_out>;
			};
		};
	};

Then one needs to extend the dispX node:

	lcd_display: disp1 {

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			lcd_display_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcd_panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};

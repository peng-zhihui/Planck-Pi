BOE HV070WSA-100 7.01" WSVGA TFT LCD panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "boe,hv070wsa-100"
- power-supply: regulator to provide the VCC supply voltage (3.3 volts)
- enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable and disable panel (active high)

This binding is compatible with the simple-panel binding, which is specified
in simple-panel.txt in this directory.

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in [1]. This
node should describe panel's video bus.

Example:

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "boe,hv070wsa-100";
		power-supply = <&vcc_3v3_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpd1 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		port {
			panel_ep: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&bridge_out_ep>;
			};
		};
	};

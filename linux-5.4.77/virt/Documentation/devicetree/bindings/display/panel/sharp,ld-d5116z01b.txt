Sharp LD-D5116Z01B 12.3" WUXGA+ eDP panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sharp,ld-d5116z01b"
- power-supply: regulator to provide the VCC supply voltage (3.3 volts)

This binding is compatible with the simple-panel binding.

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in [1]. This
node should describe panel's video bus.

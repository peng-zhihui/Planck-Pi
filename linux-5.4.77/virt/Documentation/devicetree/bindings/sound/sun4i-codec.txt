  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain the following:
   - "apb": the parent APB clock for this controller
   - "codec": the parent module clock

Optional properties:

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-codec"

- allwinner,audio-routing: A list of the connections between audio components.
			   Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			   connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			   source. Valid names include:

			   Audio pins on the SoC:
			   "HP"
			   "HPCOM"
			   "LINEIN"	(not on sun8i-v3s)
			   "LINEOUT"	(not on sun8i-a23 or sun8i-v3s)
			   "MIC1"
			   "MIC2"	(not on sun8i-v3s)
			   "MIC3"	(sun6i-a31 only)
			   "MIC"	(suniv-f1c100s only)

			   Microphone biases from the SoC:
			   "HBIAS"
			   "MBIAS"	(not on sun8i-v3s)

			   Board connectors:
			   "Headphone"
			   "Headset Mic"
			   "Line In"
			   "Line Out"
			   "Right FM In"	(suniv-f1c100s only)
			   "Left FM In"		(suniv-f1c100s only)
			   "Mic"
			   "Speaker"

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-codec"
- allwinner,codec-analog-controls: A phandle to the codec analog controls
				   block in the PRCM.

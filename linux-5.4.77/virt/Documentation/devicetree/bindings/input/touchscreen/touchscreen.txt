General Touchscreen Properties:

Optional properties for Touchscreens:
 - touchscreen-min-x		: minimum x coordinate reported (0 if not set)
 - touchscreen-min-y		: minimum y coordinate reported (0 if not set)
 - touchscreen-size-x		: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
				  (maximum x coordinate reported + 1)
 - touchscreen-size-y		: vertical resolution of touchscreen
				  (maximum y coordinate reported + 1)
 - touchscreen-max-pressure	: maximum reported pressure (arbitrary range
				  dependent on the controller)
 - touchscreen-min-pressure	: minimum pressure on the touchscreen to be
				  achieved in order for the touchscreen
				  driver to report a touch event.
 - touchscreen-fuzz-x		: horizontal noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-y		: vertical noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-pressure	: pressure noise value of the absolute input
				  device (arbitrary range dependent on the
				  controller)
 - touchscreen-average-samples : Number of data samples which are averaged
				  for each read (valid values dependent on the
				  controller)
 - touchscreen-inverted-x	: X axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-inverted-y	: Y axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-swapped-x-y	: X and Y axis are swapped (boolean)
				  Swapping is done after inverting the axis
 - touchscreen-x-mm		: horizontal length in mm of the touchscreen
 - touchscreen-y-mm		: vertical length in mm of the touchscreen

Deprecated properties for Touchscreens:
 - x-size			: deprecated name for touchscreen-size-x
 - y-size			: deprecated name for touchscreen-size-y
 - moving-threshold		: deprecated name for a combination of
				  touchscreen-fuzz-x and touchscreen-fuzz-y
 - contact-threshold		: deprecated name for touchscreen-fuzz-pressure

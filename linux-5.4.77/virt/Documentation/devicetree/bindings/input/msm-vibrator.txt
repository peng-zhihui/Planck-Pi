* Device tree bindings for the Qualcomm MSM vibrator

Required properties:

  - compatible: Should be one of
		"qcom,msm8226-vibrator"
		"qcom,msm8974-vibrator"
  - reg: the base address and length of the IO memory for the registers.
  - pinctrl-names: set to default.
  - pinctrl-0: phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes. See
               Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
  - clock-names: set to pwm
  - clocks: phandle of the clock. See
            Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  - enable-gpios: GPIO that enables the vibrator.

Optional properties:

  - vcc-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides power to the sensor.

Example from a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone:

vibrator@fd8c3450 {
	reg = <0xfd8c3450 0x400>;
	compatible = "qcom,msm8974-vibrator";

	vcc-supply = <&pm8941_l19>;

	clocks = <&mmcc CAMSS_GP1_CLK>;
	clock-names = "pwm";

	enable-gpios = <&msmgpio 60 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&vibrator_pin>;
};

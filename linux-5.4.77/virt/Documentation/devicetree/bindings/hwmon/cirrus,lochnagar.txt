Cirrus Logic Lochnagar Audio Development Board

Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus Logic
Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of most Cirrus
Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing connection of
various application processor systems to provide a full evaluation
platform.  Audio system topology, clocking and power can all be
controlled through the Lochnagar, allowing the device under test
to be used in a variety of possible use cases.

Allwinner A80 USB Clock Control Binding
---------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible: must contain one of the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun9i-a80-usb-clocks"

- reg: Must contain the registers base address and length
- clocks: phandle to the clocks feeding the USB subsystem. Two are needed:
  - "bus": the bus clock for the whole USB subsystem
  - "hosc": the high frequency oscillator (usually at 24MHz)
- clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above
- #clock-cells : must contain 1
- #reset-cells : must contain 1

Example:
usb_clocks: clock@a08000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun9i-a80-usb-clks";
	reg = <0x00a08000 0x8>;
	clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_USB>, <&osc24M>;
	clock-names = "bus", "hosc";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};

  # Card Detection.

  # *NOTE* on CD and WP polarity. To use common for all SD/MMC host
  # controllers line polarity properties, we have to fix the meaning
  # of the "normal" and "inverted" line levels. We choose to follow
  # the SDHCI standard, which specifies both those lines as "active
  # low." Therefore, using the "cd-inverted" property means, that the
  # CD line is active high, i.e. it is high, when a card is
  # inserted. Similar logic applies to the "wp-inverted" property.
  #
  # CD and WP lines can be implemented on the hardware in one of two
  # ways: as GPIOs, specified in cd-gpios and wp-gpios properties, or
  # as dedicated pins. Polarity of dedicated pins can be specified,
  # using *-inverted properties. GPIO polarity can also be specified
  # using the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag. This creates an ambiguity in the
  # latter case. We choose to use the XOR logic for GPIO CD and WP
  # lines.  This means, the two properties are "superimposed," for
  # example leaving the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag clear and specifying the
  # respective *-inverted property property results in a
  # double-inversion and actually means the "normal" line polarity is
  # in effect.

    description:
      When set, no physical write-protect line is present. This
      property should only be specified when the controller has a
      dedicated write-protect detection logic. If a GPIO is always
      used for the write-protect detection. If a GPIO is always used
      for the write-protect detection logic, it is sufficient to not
      specify the wp-gpios property in the absence of a write-protect
      line.

      for the subnode, as specified by the compatible string.

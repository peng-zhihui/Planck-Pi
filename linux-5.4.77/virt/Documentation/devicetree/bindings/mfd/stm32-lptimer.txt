STMicroelectronics STM32 Low-Power Timer

The STM32 Low-Power Timer (LPTIM) is a 16-bit timer that provides several
functions:
- PWM output (with programmable prescaler, configurable polarity)
- Quadrature encoder, counter
- Trigger source for STM32 ADC/DAC (LPTIM_OUT)

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-lptimer".
- reg:			Offset and length of the device's register set.
- clocks:		Phandle to the clock used by the LP Timer module.
- clock-names:		Must be "mux".
- #address-cells:	Should be '<1>'.
- #size-cells:		Should be '<0>'.

Optional subnodes:
- pwm:			See ../pwm/pwm-stm32-lp.txt
- counter:		See ../counter/stm32-lptimer-cnt.txt
- trigger:		See ../iio/timer/stm32-lptimer-trigger.txt

Example:

	timer@40002400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer";
		reg = <0x40002400 0x400>;
		clocks = <&timer_clk>;
		clock-names = "mux";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		pwm {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm-lp";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&lppwm1_pins>;
		};

		trigger@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer-trigger";
			reg = <0>;
		};

		counter {
			compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer-counter";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&lptim1_in_pins>;
		};
	};

MAX77650 ultra low-power PMIC from Maxim Integrated.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible:		Must be "maxim,max77650"
- reg:			I2C device address.
- interrupts:		The interrupt on the parent the controller is
			connected to.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells:	Must be <2>.

- gpio-controller:	Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells:		Must be <2>. The first cell is the pin number and
			the second cell is used to specify the gpio active
			state.

Optional properties:
--------------------
gpio-line-names:	Single string containing the name of the GPIO line.

The GPIO-controller module is represented as part of the top-level PMIC
node. The device exposes a single GPIO line.

For device-tree bindings of other sub-modules (regulator, power supply,
LEDs and onkey) refer to the binding documents under the respective
sub-system directories.

For more details on GPIO bindings, please refer to the generic GPIO DT
binding document <devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt>.

Example:
--------

	pmic@48 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77650";
		reg = <0x48>;

		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-line-names = "max77650-charger";
	};

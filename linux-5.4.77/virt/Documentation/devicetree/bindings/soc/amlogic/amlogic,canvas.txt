Amlogic Canvas
================================

A canvas is a collection of metadata that describes a pixel buffer.
Those metadata include: width, height, phyaddr, wrapping and block mode.
Starting with GXBB the endianness can also be described.

Many IPs within Amlogic SoCs rely on canvas indexes to read/write pixel data
rather than use the phy addresses directly. For instance, this is the case for
the video decoders and the display.

Amlogic SoCs have 256 canvas.

Required properties:
- compatible: has to be one of:
		- "amlogic,meson8-canvas", "amlogic,canvas" on Meson8
		- "amlogic,meson8b-canvas", "amlogic,canvas" on Meson8b
		- "amlogic,meson8m2-canvas", "amlogic,canvas" on Meson8m2
		- "amlogic,canvas" on GXBB and newer
- reg: Base physical address and size of the canvas registers.

Example:

canvas: video-lut@48 {
	compatible = "amlogic,canvas";
	reg = <0x0 0x48 0x0 0x14>;
};

       -  File descriptor returned by a previous call to open().

Description
-----------

This ioctl call asks the Audio Device to bypass the Audio decoder and
forward the stream without decoding. This mode shall be used if streams
that canâ€™t be handled by the Digital TV system shall be decoded. Dolby
DigitalTM streams are automatically forwarded by the Digital TV subsystem if
the hardware can handle it.


Return Value
------------

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.

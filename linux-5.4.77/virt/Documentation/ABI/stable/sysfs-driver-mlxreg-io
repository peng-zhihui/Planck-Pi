KernelVersion:	4.19
Contact:	Vadim Pasternak <vadimpmellanox.com>
Description:	These files allow asserting system power cycling, switching
		power supply units on and off and system's main power domain
		shutdown.
		Expected behavior:
		When pwr_cycle is written 1: auxiliary power domain will go
		down and after short period (about 1 second) up.
		When  psu1_on or psu2_on is written 1, related unit will be
		disconnected from the power source, when written 0 - connected.
		If both are written 1 - power supplies main power domain will
		go down.
		When pwr_down is written 1, system's main power domain will go
		down.

		The files are write only.

Description:	These files show the system reset cause, as following: power
		auxiliary outage or power refresh, ASIC thermal shutdown, halt,
		hotswap, watchdog, firmware reset, long press power button,
		short press power button, software reset. Value 1 in file means
		this is reset cause, 0 - otherwise. Only one of the above
		causes could be 1 at the same time, representing only last
		reset cause.

/**
 * DOC: page_pool allocator
 *
 * This page_pool allocator is optimized for the XDP mode that
 * uses one-frame-per-page, but have fallbacks that act like the
 * regular page allocator APIs.
 *
 * Basic use involve replacing alloc_pages() calls with the
 * page_pool_alloc_pages() call.  Drivers should likely use
 * page_pool_dev_alloc_pages() replacing dev_alloc_pages().
 *
 * API keeps track of in-flight pages, in-order to let API user know
 * when it is safe to dealloactor page_pool object.  Thus, API users
 * must make sure to call page_pool_release_page() when a page is
 * "leaving" the page_pool.  Or call page_pool_put_page() where
 * appropiate.  For maintaining correct accounting.
 *
 * API user must only call page_pool_put_page() once on a page, as it
 * will either recycle the page, or in case of elevated refcnt, it
 * will release the DMA mapping and in-flight state accounting.  We
 * hope to lift this requirement in the future.

 * Fast allocation side cache array/stack
 *
 * The cache size and refill watermark is related to the network
 * use-case.  The NAPI budget is 64 packets.  After a NAPI poll the RX
 * ring is usually refilled and the max consumed elements will be 64,
 * thus a natural max size of objects needed in the cache.
 *
 * Keeping room for more objects, is due to XDP_DROP use-case.  As
 * XDP_DROP allows the opportunity to recycle objects directly into
 * this array, as it shares the same softirq/NAPI protection.  If
 * cache is already full (or partly full) then the XDP_DROP recycles
 * would have to take a slower code path.

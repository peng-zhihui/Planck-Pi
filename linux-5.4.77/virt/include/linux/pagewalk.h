 *			the pmd_entry or pte_entry callbacks will be used for
 *			regular PUDs.
 * @pmd_entry:		if set, called for each non-empty PMD (3rd-level) entry
 *			this handler is required to be able to handle
 *			pmd_trans_huge() pmds.  They may simply choose to
 *			split_huge_page() instead of handling it explicitly.
 * @pte_entry:		if set, called for each non-empty PTE (4th-level) entry
 * @pte_hole:		if set, called for each hole at all levels
 * @hugetlb_entry:	if set, called for each hugetlb entry
 * @test_walk:		caller specific callback function to determine whether
 *			we walk over the current vma or not. Returning 0 means
 *			"do page table walk over the current vma", returning
 *			a negative value means "abort current page table walk
 *			right now" and returning 1 means "skip the current vma"

/**
 * struct drm_panel_funcs - perform operations on a given panel
 *
 * The .prepare() function is typically called before the display controller
 * starts to transmit video data. Panel drivers can use this to turn the panel
 * on and wait for it to become ready. If additional configuration is required
 * (via a control bus such as I2C, SPI or DSI for example) this is a good time
 * to do that.
 *
 * After the display controller has started transmitting video data, it's safe
 * to call the .enable() function. This will typically enable the backlight to
 * make the image on screen visible. Some panels require a certain amount of
 * time or frames before the image is displayed. This function is responsible
 * for taking this into account before enabling the backlight to avoid visual
 * glitches.
 *
 * Before stopping video transmission from the display controller it can be
 * necessary to turn off the panel to avoid visual glitches. This is done in
 * the .disable() function. Analogously to .enable() this typically involves
 * turning off the backlight and waiting for some time to make sure no image
 * is visible on the panel. It is then safe for the display controller to
 * cease transmission of video data.
 *
 * To save power when no video data is transmitted, a driver can power down
 * the panel. This is the job of the .unprepare() function.

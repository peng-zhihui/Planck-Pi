	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Say y here to support iMX's remote processors (Cortex M4
	  on iMX7D) via the remote processor framework.

	  It's safe to say N here.

	help
	  Say y here to support OMAP's remote processors (dual M3
	  and DSP on OMAP4) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently only supported on OMAP4.

	  Usually you want to say Y here, in order to enable multimedia
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  It's safe to say N here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading or just want a bare minimum kernel.

	depends on SOC_AM33XX || SOC_AM43XX
	help
	  Say y here to support Wakeup M3 remote processor on TI AM33xx
	  and AM43xx family of SoCs.

	  Required for Suspend-to-RAM on AM33xx and AM43xx SoCs. Also needed
	  for deep CPUIdle states on AM33xx SoCs. Allows for loading of the
	  firmware onto these remote processors.
	  If unsure say N.

	  Say y here to support DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remote processors via the
	  remote processor framework.

	  You want to say y here in order to enable AMP
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  This module controls the name of the firmware file that gets
	  loaded on the DSP.  This file must reside in the /lib/firmware
	  directory.  It can be specified via the module parameter
	  da8xx_fw_name=<filename>, and if not specified will default to
	  "rproc-dsp-fw".

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading.

config KEYSTONE_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "Keystone Remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_KEYSTONE
	help
	  Say Y here here to support Keystone remote processors (DSP)
	  via the remote processor framework.

	  It's safe to say N here if you're not interested in the Keystone
	  DSPs or just want to use a bare minimum kernel.

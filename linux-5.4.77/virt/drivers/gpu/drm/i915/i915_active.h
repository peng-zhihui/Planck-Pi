/*
 * We treat requests as fences. This is not be to confused with our
 * "fence registers" but pipeline synchronisation objects ala GL_ARB_sync.
 * We use the fences to synchronize access from the CPU with activity on the
 * GPU, for example, we should not rewrite an object's PTE whilst the GPU
 * is reading them. We also track fences at a higher level to provide
 * implicit synchronisation around GEM objects, e.g. set-domain will wait
 * for outstanding GPU rendering before marking the object ready for CPU
 * access, or a pageflip will wait until the GPU is complete before showing
 * the frame on the scanout.
 *
 * In order to use a fence, the object must track the fence it needs to
 * serialise with. For example, GEM objects want to track both read and
 * write access so that we can perform concurrent read operations between
 * the CPU and GPU engines, as well as waiting for all rendering to
 * complete, or waiting for the last GPU user of a "fence register". The
 * object then embeds a #i915_active_request to track the most recent (in
 * retirement order) request relevant for the desired mode of access.
 * The #i915_active_request is updated with i915_active_request_set() to
 * track the most recent fence request, typically this is done as part of
 * i915_vma_move_to_active().
 *
 * When the #i915_active_request completes (is retired), it will
 * signal its completion to the owner through a callback as well as mark
 * itself as idle (i915_active_request.request == NULL). The owner
 * can then perform any action, such as delayed freeing of an active
 * resource including itself.

	 *
	 *				rq = new submission on a new object
	 * ref(rq)
	 *
	 * To prevent the request from being reused whilst the caller
	 * uses it, we take a reference like normal. Whilst acquiring
	 * the reference we check that it is not in a destroyed state
	 * (refcnt == 0). That prevents the request being reallocated
	 * whilst the caller holds on to it. To check that the request
	 * was not reallocated as we acquired the reference we have to
	 * check that our request remains the active request across
	 * the lookup, in the same manner as a seqlock. The visibility
	 * of the pointer versus the reference counting is controlled
	 * by using RCU barriers (rcu_dereference and rcu_assign_pointer).
	 *
	 * In the middle of all that, we inspect whether the request is
	 * complete. Retiring is lazy so the request may be completed long
	 * before the active tracker is updated. Querying whether the
	 * request is complete is far cheaper (as it involves no locked
	 * instructions setting cachelines to exclusive) than acquiring
	 * the reference, so we do it first. The RCU read lock ensures the
	 * pointer dereference is valid, but does not ensure that the
	 * seqno nor HWS is the right one! However, if the request was
	 * reallocated, that means the active tracker's request was complete.
	 * If the new request is also complete, then both are and we can
	 * just report the active tracker is idle. If the new request is
	 * incomplete, then we acquire a reference on it and check that
	 * it remained the active request.
	 *
	 * It is then imperative that we do not zero the request on
	 * reallocation, so that we can chase the dangling pointers!

 * track every single request associated with the task, but knowing that

 * composite shared-fence, and is updated as new work is submitted to the task,
 * forming a snapshot of the current status. It should be embedded into the
 * different resources that need to track their associated GPU activity to
 * provide a callback when that GPU activity has ceased, or otherwise to
 * provide a serialisation point either for request submission or for CPU

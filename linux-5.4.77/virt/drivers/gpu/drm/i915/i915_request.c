	 * We may use a rather large value here to offset the penalty of
	 * switching away from the active task. Frequently, the client will
	 * wait upon an old swapbuffer to throttle itself to remain within a
	 * frame of the gpu. If the client is running in lockstep with the gpu,
	 * then it should not be waiting long at all, and a sleep now will incur
	 * extra scheduler latency in producing the next frame. To try to
	 * avoid adding the cost of enabling/disabling the interrupt to the
	 * short wait, we first spin to see if the request would have completed
	 * in the time taken to setup the interrupt.
	 *
	 * We need upto 5us to enable the irq, and upto 20us to hide the
	 * scheduler latency of a context switch, ignoring the secondary
	 * impacts from a context switch such as cache eviction.
	 *
	 * The scheme used for low-latency IO is called "hybrid interrupt
	 * polling". The suggestion there is to sleep until just before you
	 * expect to be woken by the device interrupt and then poll for its
	 * completion. That requires having a good predictor for the request
	 * duration, which we currently lack.

config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_VSOC
	tristate "Android Virtual SoC support"
	depends on PCI_MSI
	help
	  This option adds support for the Virtual SoC driver needed to boot
	  a 'cuttlefish' Android image inside QEmu. The driver interacts with
	  a QEmu ivshmem device. If built as a module, it will be called vsoc.

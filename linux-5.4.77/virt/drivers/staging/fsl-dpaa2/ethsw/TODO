* Add I/O capabilities on switch port netdevices. This will allow control
traffic to reach the CPU.
* Add ACL to redirect control traffic to CPU.
* Add support for multiple FDBs and switch port partitioning
* MC firmware uprev; the DPAA2 objects used by the Ethernet Switch driver
need to be kept in sync with binary interface changes in MC
* refine README file
* cleanup

NOTE: At least first three of the above are required before getting the
DPAA2 Ethernet Switch driver out of staging. Another requirement is that
dpio driver is moved to drivers/soc (this is required for I/O).

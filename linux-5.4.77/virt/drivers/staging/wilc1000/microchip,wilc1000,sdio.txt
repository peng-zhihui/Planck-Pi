* Microchip WILC wireless SDIO device

The wilc1000 chips can be connected via SDIO. The node is used to specifiy
child node to the SDIO controller that connects the device to the system.

Required properties:
- compatible	:	Should be "microchip,wilc1000-spi"
- irq-gpios	:	Connect to a host IRQ
- reg		:	Slot ID used in the controller

Optional:
- bus-width	:	Number of data lines wired up the slot. Default 1 bit.
- rtc_clk	:	Clock connected on the rtc clock line. Must be assigned
			a frequency with assigned-clocks property, and must be
			connected to a clock provider.

Examples:
mmc1: mmc@fc000000 {
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mmc1_clk_cmd_dat0 &pinctrl_mmc1_dat1_3>;
		non-removable;
		vmmc-supply = <&vcc_mmc1_reg>;
		vqmmc-supply = <&vcc_3v3_reg>;
		status = "okay";

		wilc_sdio@0 {
			compatible = "microchip,wilc1000-sdio";
			irq-gpios = <&pioC 27 0>;
			clocks = <&pck1>;
			clock-names = "rtc_clk";
			assigned-clocks = <&pck1>;
			assigned-clock-rates = <32768>;
			status = "okay";
			reg = <0>;
			bus-width = <4>;
		}
	};
}

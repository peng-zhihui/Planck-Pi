	bool "Qualcomm Command DB"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on OF_RESERVED_MEM
	help
	  Command DB queries shared memory by key string for shared system
	  resources. Platform drivers that require to set state of a shared
	  resource on a RPM-hardened platform must use this database to get
	  SoC specific identifier and information for the shared resources.

config QCOM_RMTFS_MEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Remote Filesystem memory driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  The Qualcomm remote filesystem memory driver is used for allocating
	  and exposing regions of shared memory with remote processors for the
	  purpose of exchanging sector-data between the remote filesystem
	  service and its clients.

	  Say y here if you intend to boot the modem remoteproc.

config QCOM_RPMH
	bool "Qualcomm RPM-Hardened (RPMH) Communication"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Support for communication with the hardened-RPM blocks in
	  Qualcomm Technologies Inc (QTI) SoCs. RPMH communication uses an
	  internal bus to transmit state requests for shared resources. A set
	  of hardware components aggregate requests for these resources and
	  help apply the aggregated state on the resource.

	bool "Qualcomm RPMh Power domain driver"
	depends on QCOM_RPMH && QCOM_COMMAND_DB
	help
	  QCOM RPMh Power domain driver to support power-domains with
	  performance states. The driver communicates a performance state
	  value to RPMh which then translates it into corresponding voltage
	  for the voltage rail.

config QCOM_RPMPD
	bool "Qualcomm RPM Power domain driver"
	depends on QCOM_SMD_RPM=y
	help
	  QCOM RPM Power domain driver to support power-domains with
	  performance states. The driver communicates a performance state
	  value to RPM which then translates it into corresponding voltage

	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

	 This is a KMS driver for emulated cirrus device in qemu.
	 It is *NOT* intended for real cirrus devices. This requires
	 the modesetting userspace X.org driver.

	 Cirrus is obsolete, the hardware was designed in the 90ies
	 and can't keep up with todays needs.  More background:
	 https://www.kraxel.org/blog/2014/10/qemu-using-cirrus-considered-harmful/

	 Better alternatives are:
	   - stdvga (DRM_BOCHS, qemu -vga std, default in qemu 2.2+)
	   - qxl (DRM_QXL, qemu -vga qxl, works best with spice)
	   - virtio (DRM_VIRTIO_GPU), qemu -vga virtio)

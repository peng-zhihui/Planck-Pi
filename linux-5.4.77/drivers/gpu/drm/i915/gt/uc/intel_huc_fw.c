/**
 * DOC: HuC Firmware
 *
 * Motivation:
 * GEN9 introduces a new dedicated firmware for usage in media HEVC (High
 * Efficiency Video Coding) operations. Userspace can use the firmware
 * capabilities by adding HuC specific commands to batch buffers.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * The same firmware loader is used as the GuC. However, the actual
 * loading to HW is deferred until GEM initialization is done.
 *
 * Note that HuC firmware loading must be done before GuC loading.

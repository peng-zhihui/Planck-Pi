* Microchip WILC wireless SPI device

The wilc1000 chips can be connected via SPI. This document describes
the binding for the SPI connected module.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "microchip,wilc1000-spi"
- spi-max-frequency	: Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- reg			: Chip select address of device
- irq-gpios		: Connect to a host IRQ

Optional:
- rtc_clk	:	Clock connected on the rtc clock line. Must be assigned
			a frequency with assigned-clocks property, and must be
			connected to a clock provider.

Examples:

spi1: spi@fc018000 {
		cs-gpios = <&pioB 21 0>;
		status = "okay";

		wilc_spi@0 {
			compatible = "microchip,wilc1000-spi";
			spi-max-frequency = <48000000>;
			reg = <0>;
			irq-gpios = <&pioC 27 0>;
			clocks = <&pck1>;
			clock-names = "rtc_clk";
			assigned-clocks = <&pck1>;
			assigned-clock-rates = <32768>;
			status = "okay";
		};
};

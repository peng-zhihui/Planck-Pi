TODO:
	- sparse fixes
	- rename files to be not so "generic"
	- add proper arch dependencies as needed
	- audit userspace interfaces to make sure they are sane


ion/
 - Split /dev/ion up into multiple nodes (e.g. /dev/ion/heap0)
 - Better test framework (integration with VGEM was suggested)

vsoc.c, uapi/vsoc_shm.h
 - The current driver uses the same wait queue for all of the futexes in a
   region. This will cause false wakeups in regions with a large number of
   waiting threads. We should eventually use multiple queues and select the
   queue based on the region.
 - Add debugfs support for examining the permissions of regions.
 - Remove VSOC_WAIT_FOR_INCOMING_INTERRUPT ioctl. This functionality has been
   superseded by the futex and is there for legacy reasons.

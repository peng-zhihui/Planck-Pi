config MEDIA_CONTROLLER
	bool "Media Controller API"
	depends on MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT || MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT || MEDIA_DIGITAL_TV_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable the media controller API used to query media devices internal
	  topology and configure it dynamically.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

config MEDIA_CONTROLLER_DVB
	bool "Enable Media controller for DVB (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MEDIA_CONTROLLER && DVB_CORE
	help
	  Enable the media controller API support for DVB.

	  This is currently experimental.

config MEDIA_CONTROLLER_REQUEST_API
	bool "Enable Media controller Request API (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MEDIA_CONTROLLER && STAGING_MEDIA
	help
	  DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

	  This option enables the Request API for the Media controller and V4L2
	  interfaces. It is currently needed by a few stateless codec drivers.

	  There is currently no intention to provide API or ABI stability for
	  this new API as of yet.

	  This is the framework for the SPI NOR which can be used by the SPI
	  device drivers and the SPI-NOR device driver.

	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	  This enables support for the Firmware Memory controller (FMC)
	  in the Aspeed AST2500/AST2400 SoCs when attached to SPI NOR chips,
	  and support for the SPI flash memory controller (SPI) for
	  the host firmware. The implementation only supports SPI NOR.

	  Enable support for the Cadence Quad SPI Flash controller.

	  Cadence QSPI is a specialized controller for connecting an SPI
	  Flash over 1/2/4-bit wide bus. Enable this option if you have a
	  device with a Cadence QSPI controller and want to access the
	  Flash as an MTD device.

	  Enable support for the NXP LPC SPI Flash Interface controller.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

	  This enables PCI support for the Intel PCH/PCU SPI controller in

	  this driver it is possible to upgrade BIOS directly from Linux.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module

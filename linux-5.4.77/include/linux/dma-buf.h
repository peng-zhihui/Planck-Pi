	 * users of the various kmap interfaces, where the backing storage must
	 * be pinned to guarantee that the atomic kmap calls can succeed. Since
	 * there's no in-kernel users of the kmap interfaces yet this isn't a
	 * real problem.

	 * Note that the mapping needs to be incoherent, userspace is expected
	 * to braket CPU access using the DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC interface.
	 *
	 * Because dma-buf buffers have invariant size over their lifetime, the
	 * dma-buf core checks whether a vma is too large and rejects such
	 * mappings. The exporter hence does not need to duplicate this check.
	 * Drivers do not need to check this themselves.
	 *
	 * If an exporter needs to manually flush caches and hence needs to fake
	 * coherency for mmap support, it needs to be able to zap all the ptes
	 * pointing at the backing storage. Now linux mm needs a struct
	 * address_space associated with the struct file stored in vma->vm_file
	 * to do that with the function unmap_mapping_range. But the dma_buf
	 * framework only backs every dma_buf fd with the anon_file struct file,
	 * i.e. all dma_bufs share the same file.
	 *
	 * Hence exporters need to setup their own file (and address_space)
	 * association by setting vma->vm_file and adjusting vma->vm_pgoff in
	 * the dma_buf mmap callback. In the specific case of a gem driver the
	 * exporter could use the shmem file already provided by gem (and set
	 * vm_pgoff = 0). Exporters can then zap ptes by unmapping the
	 * corresponding range of the struct address_space associated with their
	 * own file.

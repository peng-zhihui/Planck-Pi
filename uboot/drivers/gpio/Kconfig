	  This driver supports some simulated GPIOs which can be adjusted
	  using 'back door' functions like sandbox_gpio_set_value(). Then the
	  GPIOs can be inspected through the normal get_get_value()
	  interface. The purpose of this is to allow GPIOs to be used as

	bool "Freescale MPC8XXX GPIO driver"
	depends on DM_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports the built-in GPIO controller of MPC8XXX CPUs.

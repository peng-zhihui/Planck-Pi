	help
	  Enable system reset drivers which can be used to reset the CPU or
	  board. Each driver can provide a reset method which will be called
	  to effect a reset. The uclass will try all available drivers when
	  reset_walk() is called.

config SPL_SYSRESET
	bool "Enable support for system reset drivers in SPL mode"
	depends on SYSRESET && SPL_DM
	help
	  Enable system reset drivers which can be used to reset the CPU or
	  board. Each driver can provide a reset method which will be called
	  to effect a reset. The uclass will try all available drivers when
	  reset_walk() is called.

config TPL_SYSRESET
	bool "Enable support for system reset drivers in TPL mode"
	depends on SYSRESET && TPL_DM
	help
	  Enable system reset drivers which can be used to reset the CPU or
	  board. Each driver can provide a reset method which will be called
	  to effect a reset. The uclass will try all available drivers when

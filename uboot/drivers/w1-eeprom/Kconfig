	  Maxim DS2502 1-Wire add-only memory support.
	  This device has 128 bytes of data memory, organized as 4 pages of
	  32 bytes and 8 out of band status bytes that may be used to redirect
	  pages, allowing data to be modified up to 4 times (by external
	  programming).

	  The device may be seen as a 32 byte memory, using the page redirection
	  or as a 128 byte memory, ignoring the page redirection.

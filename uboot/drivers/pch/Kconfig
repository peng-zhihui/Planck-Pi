config PCH
	bool "Enable Platform-controller Hub (PCH) support"
	depends on X86 || SANDBOX
	help
	  Most x86 chips include a PCH which is responsible for handling
	  parts of the system not handled by that CPU. It supersedes the
	  northbridge / southbridge architecture that was previously used. The
	  PCH allows for higher performance since the memory functions are
	  handled in the CPU.

config X86_PCH7
	bool "Add support for Intel PCH7"
	default y if X86
	help
	  Enable this if your SoC uses Platform Controller Hub 7 (PCH7). This
	  dates from about 2011 and is used on baytrail, for example. The
	  PCH provides access to the GPIO and SPI base addresses, among other
	  functions.

config X86_PCH9
	bool "Add support for Intel PCH9"
	default y if X86
	help
	  Enable this if your SoC uses Platform Controller Hub 9 (PCH9). This
	  dates from about 2015 and is used on baytrail, for example. The
	  PCH provides access to the GPIO and SPI base addresses, among other
	  functions.

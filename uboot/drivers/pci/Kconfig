config PCI_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox PCI support"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM_PCI
	help
	  Support PCI on sandbox, as an emulated bus. This permits testing of
	  PCI feature such as bus scanning, device configuration and device
	  access. The available (emulated) devices are defined statically in
	  the device tree but the normal PCI scan technique is used to find
	  then.

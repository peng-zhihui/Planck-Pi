config VIDEO_BRIDGE
	bool "Support video bridges"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Some platforms use video bridges to convert from one output to
	  another. For example, where the SoC only supports eDP and the LCD
	  requires LVDS, an eDP->LVDS bridge chip can be used to provide the
	  necessary conversion. This option enables support for these devices.

config VIDEO_BRIDGE_PARADE_PS862X
	bool "Support Parade PS862X DP->LVDS bridge"
	depends on VIDEO_BRIDGE
	help
	  The Parade PS8622 and PS8625 are DisplayPort-to-LVDS (Low voltage
	  differential signalling) converters. They enable an LVDS LCD panel
	  to be connected to an eDP output device such as an SoC that lacks
	  LVDS capability, or where LVDS requires too many signals to route
	  on the PCB. Setup parameters are provided in the device tree.

config VIDEO_BRIDGE_NXP_PTN3460
	bool "Support NXP PTN3460 DP->LVDS bridge"
	depends on VIDEO_BRIDGE
	help
	  The NXP PTN3460 is a DisplayPort-to-LVDS (Low voltage differential
	  signalling) converter. It enables an LVDS LCD panel to be connected
	  to an eDP output device such as an SoC that lacks LVDS capability,
	  or where LVDS requires too many signals to route on the PCB.

config VIDEO_BRIDGE_ANALOGIX_ANX6345
	bool "Support Analogix ANX6345 RGB->DP bridge"
	depends on VIDEO_BRIDGE
	select DM_I2C
	help
	 The Analogix ANX6345 is RGB-to-DP converter. It enables an eDP LCD
	 panel to be connected to an parallel LCD interface.

config BLK
	bool "Support block devices"
	depends on DM
	default y if DM_MMC
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE
	bool "Enable Legacy Block Device"
	help
	  Some devices require block support whether or not DM is enabled

config SPL_BLK
	bool "Support block devices in SPL"
	depends on SPL_DM && BLK
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config TPL_BLK
	bool "Support block devices in TPL"
	depends on TPL_DM && BLK
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	depends on BLK
	default y
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config SPL_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache in SPL"
	depends on SPL_BLK
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in SPL

config TPL_BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache in TPL"
	depends on TPL_BLK
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the disk-block cache in TPL

config IDE
	bool "Support IDE controllers"
	select HAVE_BLOCK_DEVICE
	help
	  Enables support for IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drives.
	  This allows access to raw blocks and filesystems on an IDE drive
	  from U-Boot. See also CMD_IDE which provides an 'ide' command for
	  performing various IDE operations.

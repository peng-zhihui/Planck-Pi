	  Support the one wire controller found in some members of the NXP
	  i.MX SoC family.
	  There are currently two silicon variants:
	  V1: i.MX21, i.MX27, i.MX31, i.MX51
	  V2: i.MX25, i.MX35, i.MX50, i.MX53
	  Newer i.MX SoCs such as the i.MX6 do not have one wire controllers.

	  The driver supports both silicon variants.

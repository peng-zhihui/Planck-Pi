	depends on SPL_DM
	help
	  Enable drver model for real-time-clock drivers. The RTC uclass
	  then provides the rtc_get()/rtc_set() interface, delegating to
	  drivers to perform the actual functions. See rtc.h for a
	  description of the API.

config TPL_DM_RTC
	bool "Enable Driver Model for RTC drivers in TPL"
	depends on TPL_DM
	help
	  Enable drver model for real-time-clock drivers. The RTC uclass
	  then provides the rtc_get()/rtc_set() interface, delegating to
	  drivers to perform the actual functions. See rtc.h for a
	  description of the API.

config RTC_ENABLE_32KHZ_OUTPUT
	bool "Enable RTC 32Khz output"
	help
	   Some real-time clocks support the output of 32kHz square waves (such as ds3231),
	   the config symbol choose Real Time Clock device 32Khz output feature.

config RTC_PCF2127
	bool "Enable PCF2127 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The PCF2127 is a CMOS Real Time Clock (RTC) and calendar with an integrated
	  Temperature Compensated Crystal (Xtal) Oscillator (TCXO) and a 32.768 kHz quartz
	  crystal optimized for very high accuracy and very low power consumption. The PCF2127
	  has a selectable I2C-bus or SPI-bus, a backup battery switch-over circuit, a
	  programmable watchdog function, a timestamp function, and many other features.

config RTC_DS1307

	bool "Enable DS3232 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	depends on DM_I2C
	help
	  Support for Dallas Semiconductor (now Maxim) DS3232 compatible
	  Real Time Clock devices.

config RTC_ISL1208
	bool "Enable ISL1208 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The Renesas (formerly Intersil) ISL1208 is a I2C Real Time Clock (RTC) and
	  calendar with automatic leap year correction, 2-byte battery backed SRAM,
	  automatic power switch-over, alarm function and 15 selectable frequency
	  outputs.

	  This driver supports reading and writing the RTC/calendar and detects
	  total power failures.

config RTC_RV3029
	bool "Enable RV3029 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The MicroCrystal RV3029 is a I2C Real Time Clock (RTC) with 8-byte
	  battery-backed SRAM.

	  This driver supports reading and writing the RTC/calendar and the
	  battery-baced SRAM section.

config RTC_RV8803
	bool "Enable RV8803 driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help
	  The Micro Crystal RV8803 is a high accuracy, ultra-low power I2C
	  Real Time Clock (RTC) with temperature compensation.

	  This driver supports reading and writing the RTC/calendar and
	  detects total power failures.

config RTC_RX8010SJ
	bool "Enable RX8010SJ driver"
	depends on DM_RTC
	help

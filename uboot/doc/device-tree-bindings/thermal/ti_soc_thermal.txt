* Texas Instrument dra7xx SCM bandgap bindings

In the System Control Module, SoC supplies a voltage reference
and a temperature sensor feature that are gathered in the band
gap voltage and temperature sensor (VBGAPTS) module. The band
gap provides current and voltage reference for its internal
circuits and other analog IP blocks. The analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) produces an output value that is proportional
to the silicon temperature.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be:
  - "ti,dra752-bandgap"
- interrupts : this entry should indicate which interrupt line
the talert signal is routed to;
- regs : this is specific to each bandgap version, because
the mapping may change from soc to soc, apart from depending
on available features.

Optional:
- gpios : this entry should be used to inform which GPIO
line the tshut signal is routed to. The informed GPIO will
be treated as an IRQ;

Example:
bandgap {
	reg = <0x4a0021e0 0xc
		0x4a00232c 0xc
		0x4a002380 0x2c
		0x4a0023C0 0x3c
		0x4a002564 0x8
		0x4a002574 0x50>;
	compatible = "ti,dra752-bandgap";
	interrupts = <0 126 4>; /* talert */
};

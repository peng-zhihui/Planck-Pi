MediaTek T-PHY binding
--------------------------

T-phy controller supports physical layer functionality for a number of
controllers on MediaTek SoCs, such as, USB2.0, USB3.0, PCIe, and SATA.

Required properties (controller (parent) node):
 - compatible	: should be one of
		  "mediatek,generic-tphy-v1"
		  "mediatek,generic-tphy-v2"

- #address-cells:	the number of cells used to represent physical
		base addresses.
- #size-cells:	the number of cells used to represent the size of an address.
- ranges:	the address mapping relationship to the parent, defined with
		- empty value: if optional 'reg' is used.
		- non-empty value: if optional 'reg' is not used. should set
			the child's base address to 0, the physical address
			within parent's address space, and the length of
			the address map.

Required nodes	: a sub-node is required for each port the controller
		  provides. Address range information including the usual
		  'reg' property is used inside these nodes to describe
		  the controller's topology.

Optional properties (controller (parent) node):
 - reg		: offset and length of register shared by multiple ports,
		  exclude port's private register.
 - mediatek,src-ref-clk-mhz	: frequency of reference clock for slew rate
		  calibrate
 - mediatek,src-coef	: coefficient for slew rate calibrate, depends on
		  SoC process

Required properties (port (child) node):
- reg		: address and length of the register set for the port.
- #phy-cells	: should be 1 (See second example)
		  cell after port phandle is phy type from:
			- PHY_TYPE_USB2
			- PHY_TYPE_USB3
			- PHY_TYPE_PCIE
			- PHY_TYPE_SATA

Optional properties (port (child) node):
- clocks	: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
		  entry in clock-names
- clock-names	: may contain
		  "ref": 48M reference clock for HighSpeed (digital) phy; and 26M
			reference clock for SuperSpeed (digital) phy, sometimes is
			24M, 25M or 27M, depended on platform.
		  "da_ref": the reference clock of analog phy, used if the clocks
			of analog and digital phys are separated, otherwise uses
			"ref" clock only if needed.

Example:

	u3phy2: usb-phy@1a244000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,generic-tphy-v1";
		reg = <0x1a244000 0x0700>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;
		status = "disabled";

		u2port1: usb-phy@1a244800 {
			reg = <0x1a244800 0x0100>;
			clocks = <&topckgen CLK_TOP_USB_PHY48M>;
			clock-names = "ref";
			#phy-cells = <1>;
			status = "okay";
		};

		u3port1: usb-phy@1a244900 {
			reg = <0x1a244900 0x0700>;
			clocks = <&clk26m>;
			clock-names = "ref";
			#phy-cells = <1>;
			status = "okay";
		};
	};

Specifying phy control of devices
---------------------------------

Device nodes should specify the configuration required in their "phys"
property, containing a phandle to the phy port node and a device type;
phy-names for each port are optional.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/phy/phy.h>

usb30: usb@11270000 {
	...
	phys = <&u2port0 PHY_TYPE_USB2>, <&u3port0 PHY_TYPE_USB3>;
	phy-names = "usb2-0", "usb3-0";
	...
};

Layout differences of banks between TPHY V1 and V2
-------------------------------------------------------------
IP V1:

shared      0x0000    SPLLC
            0x0100    FMREG

            0x1300    U3PHYA
            0x1400    U3PHYA_DA

            0x1c00    U3PHYA_DA
u2 port2    0x2000    MISC
            ...

    SPLLC shared by u3 ports and FMREG shared by u2 ports on
TPHY V1 are put back into each port; a new bank MISC for
u2 ports and CHIP for u3 ports are added on TPHY V2.

NAND Flash
----------

(there isn't yet a generic binding in Linux, so this describes what is in
U-Boot. There should not be Linux-specific or U-Boot specific binding, just
a binding that describes this hardware. But agreeing a binding in Linux in
the absence of a driver may be beyond my powers.)

The device node for a NAND flash device is as follows:

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should be "manufacturer,device", "nand-flash"

This node should sit inside its controller.


Nvidia NAND Controller
----------------------

The device node for a NAND flash controller is as follows:

Optional properties:

nvidia,wp-gpios : GPIO of write-protect line, three cells in the format:
		phandle, parameter, flags
nvidia,nand-width : bus width of the NAND device in bits

 - nvidia,nand-timing : Timing parameters for the NAND. Each is in ns.
	Order is: MAX_TRP_TREA, TWB, Max(tCS, tCH, tALS, tALH),
	TWHR, Max(tCS, tCH, tALS, tALH), TWH, TWP, TRH, TADL

	MAX_TRP_TREA is:
		non-EDO mode: Max(tRP, tREA) + 6ns
		EDO mode: tRP timing

The 'reg' property should provide the chip select used by the flash chip.


Example
-------

nand-controller@0x70008000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-nand";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	nvidia,wp-gpios = <&gpio 59 0>;		/* PH3 */
	nvidia,nand-width = <8>;
	nvidia,timing = <26 100 20 80 20 10 12 10 70>;
	nand@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "hynix,hy27uf4g2b", "nand-flash";
	};
};

Texas Instruments K3 ESM Binding
======================

ESM (Error Signaling Module) is an IP block on TI K3 devices that allows
handling of safety events somewhat similar to what interrupt controller
would do. The safety signals have their separate paths within the SoC,
and they are handled by the ESM, which routes them to the proper
destination, which can be system reset, interrupt controller, etc. In
the simplest configuration the signals are just routed to reset the
SoC.

Required properties :
- compatible	: "ti,j721e-esm"
- ti,esm-pins	: integer array of esm events IDs to route to external event
		  pin which can be used to reset the SoC. The array can
		  have arbitrary amount of event IDs listed on it.

Example
=======

	main_esm: esm@700000 {
		compatible = "ti,j721e-esm";
		reg = <0x0 0x700000 0x0 0x1000>;
		ti,esm-pins = <344>, <345>;
	};

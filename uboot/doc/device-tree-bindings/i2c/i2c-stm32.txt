* I2C controller embedded in STMicroelectronis STM32 platforms

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be "st,stm32f7-i2c"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- resets: Must contain the phandle to the reset controller
- clocks: Must contain the input clock of the I2C instance
- A pinctrl state named "default" must be defined to set pins in mode of
  operation for I2C transfer
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Optional properties :
- clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified,
  the default 100 kHz frequency will be used. As only Normal, Fast and Fast+
  modes are implemented, possible values are 100000, 400000 and 1000000.

Example :

	i2c1: i2c@40005400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32f7-i2c";
		reg = <0x40005400 0x400>;
		resets = <&rcc 181>;
		clocks = <&clk_pclk1>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_i2c1>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};

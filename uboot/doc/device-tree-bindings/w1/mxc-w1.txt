NXP i.MX (MXC) One wire bus master controller
=======================

Child nodes are required in device tree. The driver will detect
the devices serial number and then search in the child nodes in the device tree
for the proper node and try to match it with the device.

Also check doc/device-tree-bindings/w1-eeprom for possible child nodes drivers

Driver:
- drivers/w1/mxc_w1.c

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of
	"fsl,imx21-owire", "fsl,imx27-owire", "fsl,imx31-owire", "fsl,imx25-owire"
	"fsl,imx25-owire", "fsl,imx35-owire", "fsl,imx50-owire", "fsl,imx53-owire"

- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device

Optional:
* none

Example:
	onewire {
		compatible = "fsl,imx53-owire";
		reg = <0x63fa4000 0x4000>;
	};

Example with child:
	onewire {
		compatible = "fsl,imx53-owire";
		reg = <0x63fa4000 0x4000>;

		eeprom1: eeprom@0 {
			compatible = "maxim,ds24xxx";
		};
	};

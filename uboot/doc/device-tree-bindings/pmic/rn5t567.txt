Ricoh RN5T567 PMIC

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "ricoh,rn5t567"
- reg: depending on strapping, e.g. 0x33

With those two properties, the PMIC device can be used to read/write
registers.

Example:

rn5t567@33 {
	compatible = "ricoh,rn5t567";
	reg = <0x33>;
};

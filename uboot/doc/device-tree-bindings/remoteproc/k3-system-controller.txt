Texas Instruments' K3 System Controller
=========================================

K3 specific SoCs have a dedicated microcontroller for doing
resource management. Any HLOS/firmware on compute clusters should
load a firmware to this microcontroller before accessing any resource.
This driver communicates with ROM for loading this firmware.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Shall be: "ti,am654-system-controller"
- mbox-names:		"tx" for Transfer channel
			"rx" for Receive channel
- mboxes:		Corresponding phandles to mailbox channels.


Example:
--------

system-controller: system-controller {
	compatible = "ti,am654-system-controller";
	mboxes= <&secproxy 4>, <&secproxy 5>;
	mbox-names = "tx", "rx";
};

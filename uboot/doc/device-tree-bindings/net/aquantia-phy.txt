PHY nodes for Aquantia devices.

This text describes properties that are applicable to Aquantia PHY nodes in
addition to the bindings in phy.txt.

Aquantia PHYs allow some flexibility in the way they are wired in a system,
they allow MDI pins to be reversed, LEDs linked up in different weays, have an
I2C slave interface that can be used for debug.  Normally the configuration
corresponding to these is driven by the PHY firmware with the downside that
a custom firmware is needed for each integration of a PHY.
Several optional bindings are defined that allow these configuration points to
be driven by the PHY driver and reduce dependency on specific FW versions.

Optional properties:
mdi-reversal: 0 or 1 indicating that reversal must be disabled/enabled.
              Firmware default is used if the property is missing.
smb-addr:     I2C/SMBus address to use, firmware default is used if the property
              is missing.

Example node:
phy@00 {
	reg = <0x00>;
	mdi-reversal = <1>;
	smb-addr = <0x25>;
};

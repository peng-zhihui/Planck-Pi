Qualcomm Snapdragon GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm8916-pinctrl" or "qcom,apq8016-pinctrl"
- reg : Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
	This controller is called "Top Level Mode Multiplexing" in
	Qualcomm documentation.
- #gpio-cells : Should be one (pin number).
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- gpio-count: Number of GPIO pins.
- gpio-bank-name: (optional) name of gpio bank. As default "soc" is used.

Example:

soc_gpios: pinctrl@1000000 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm8916-pinctrl";
	reg = <0x1000000 0x300000>;
	gpio-controller;
	gpio-count = <122>;
	gpio-bank-name="soc";
	#gpio-cells = <1>;
};

Altera SOCFPGA Arria10 FPGA Manager

Required properties:
- compatible : should contain "altr,socfpga-a10-fpga-mgr"
- reg        : base address and size for memory mapped io.
               - The first index is for FPGA manager register access.
               - The second index is for writing FPGA configuration data.
- resets     : Phandle and reset specifier for the device's reset.
- clocks     : Clocks used by the device.
- altr,bitstream : Fit image file name for both FPGA peripheral bitstream,
		   FPGA core bitstream and full bitstream.

		   Full bitstream, consist of peripheral bitstream and core
		   bitstream.

		   FPGA peripheral bitstream is used to initialize FPGA IOs,
		   PLL, IO48 and DDR. This bitstream is required to get DDR up
		   running.

		   FPGA core bitstream contains FPGA design which is used to
		   program FPGA CRAM and ERAM.

Example: Bundles both peripheral bitstream and core bitstream into FIT image
	 called fit_spl_fpga.itb. This FIT image can be created through running
	 this command: tools/mkimage
		       -E -p 400
		       -f board/altera/arria10-socdk/fit_spl_fpga.its
		       fit_spl_fpga.itb

	 For details of describing structure and contents of the FIT image,
	 please refer board/altera/arria10-socdk/fit_spl_fpga.its

- Examples for booting with full release or booting with early IO release, then
  follow by entering early user mode:

	fpga_mgr: fpga-mgr@ffd03000 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-a10-fpga-mgr";
		reg = <0xffd03000 0x100
		       0xffcfe400 0x20>;
		clocks = <&l4_mp_clk>;
		resets = <&rst FPGAMGR_RESET>;
		altr,bitstream = "fit_spl_fpga.itb";
	};

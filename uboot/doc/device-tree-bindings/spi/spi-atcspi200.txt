Andestech ATCSPI200 SPI controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------------
ATCSPI200 is a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) controller
which serves as a SPI master or a SPI slave.

It is often be embedded in AE3XX and AE250 platforms.

Required properties:
- compatible: has to be "andestech,atcspi200".
- reg: Base address and size of the controllers memory area.
- #address-cells: <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
- #size-cells: <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.
- interrupts: Property with a value describing the interrupt number.
- clocks: Clock phandles (see clock bindings for details).
- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz.

Optional properties:
- num-cs: Number of chip selects used.

Example:

	spi: spi@f0b00000 {
		compatible = "andestech,atcspi200";
		reg = <0xf0b00000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		num-cs = <1>;
		clocks = <&spiclk>;
		interrupts = <3 4>;
		flash@0 {
			compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
			spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
			reg = <0>;
			spi-cpol;
			spi-cpha;
		};
	};

Texas Instruments TI SCI Reset Controller
=========================================

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the SYSFW, etc...) that is
responsible for controlling the state of the IPs that are present.
Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
controller happens through a protocol known as TI SCI [1].

Reset Controller Node
=====================
The reset controller node represents the resets of various hardware modules
present on the SoC managed by the SYSFW. Because this relies on the TI SCI
protocol to communicate with the SYSFW it must be a child of the sysfw node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
 - compatible: Must be "ti,sci-reset"
 - #reset-cells: Must be 2. Please see the reset consumer node below for
		 usage details.

Example (AM65x):
----------------
	sysfw: sysfw {
		compatible = "ti,am654-system-controller";
		...
		k3_reset: reset-controller {
			compatible = "ti,sci-reset";
			#reset-cells = <2>;
		};
	};

Reset Consumers
===============
Each of the reset consumer nodes should have the following properties,
in addition to their own properties.

Required Properties:
--------------------
 - resets: A phandle and reset specifier pair, one pair for each reset signal
	   that affects the device, or that the device manages. The phandle
	   should point to the TI SCI reset controller node, and the reset
	   specifier should have 2 cell-values. The first cell should contain
	   the device ID. The second cell should contain the reset mask value
	   used by system controller.

Example (AM65x):
----------------
	uart2: serial@02800000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-uart";
		...
		resets = <&k3_reset 5 1>;
	};

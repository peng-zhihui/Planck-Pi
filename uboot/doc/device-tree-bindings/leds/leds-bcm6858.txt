LEDs connected to Broadcom BCM6858 controller

This controller is present on BCM6858, BCM6328, BCM6362 and BCM63268.
In these SoCs it's possible to control LEDs both as GPIOs or by hardware.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "brcm,bcm6858-leds".
  - #address-cells : must be 1.
  - #size-cells : must be 0.
  - reg : BCM6858 LED controller address and size.

Optional properties:
  - brcm,serial-led-msb-first : Boolean, msb data come out first on serial data pin
    Default : false
  - brcm,serial-led-en-pol : Boolean, serial led polarity (true => active high)
    Default : false
  - brcm,serial-led-clk-pol : Boolean, serial clock polarity (true => active high)
    Default : false
  - brcm,serial-led-data-ppol : Boolean, serial data polarity (true => active high)
    Default : false
  - brcm,serial-shift-inv : Boolean, led test mode
    Default : false

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the brcm,bcm6858-leds device.

LED sub-node required properties:
  - reg : LED pin number (only LEDs 0 to 32 are valid).

LED sub-node optional properties:
  - label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - active-low : Boolean, makes LED active low.
    Default : false

Examples:
BCM6328 with 2 GPIO LEDs
	leds0: led-controller@ff800800 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm6858-leds";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0xff800800 0x0 0xe4>;

		led@2 {
			reg = <2>;
			label = "green:inet";
		};

		led@5 {
			reg = <5>;
			label = "red:alarm";
		};
	};

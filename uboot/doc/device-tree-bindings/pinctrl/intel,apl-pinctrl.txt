* Intel Apollo Lake pin controller

The Apollo Lake (APL) pin controller is used to select the function of a pin
and to configure it.

Required properties:
- compatible: "intel,apl-pinctrl"
- intel,p2sb-port-id: Port ID number within the parent P2SB
- reg: PCI address of the controller

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

Optional subnodes:

GPIO nodes may be added as children of the pinctrl nodes. See intel,apl-gpio
for the binding.


Example:

...
{
	p2sb: p2sb@d,0 {
		reg = <0x02006810 0 0 0 0>;
		compatible = "intel,p2sb";
		early-regs = <IOMAP_P2SB_BAR 0x100000>;

		n {
			compatible = "intel,apl-pinctrl";
			intel,p2sb-port-id = <PID_GPIO_N>;
			gpio_n: gpio-n {
				compatible = "intel,apl-gpio";
				#gpio-cells = <2>;
			};
		};
	};
};
...

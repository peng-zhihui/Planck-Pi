Onewire EEPROM sandbox driver device binding - one wire protocol sandbox EEPROM
=======================

This memory needs to be connected to a onewire bus, as a child node.
The bus will read the device serial number and match this node with a found
device on the bus
Also check doc/device-tree-bindings/w1 for onewire bus drivers

Driver:
- drivers/w1-eeprom/eep_sandbox.c

Software ds24xxx device-tree node properties:
Required:
* compatible = "sandbox,w1-eeprom"

Optional:
* none

Example:
	eeprom1: eeprom@0 {
		compatible = "sandbox,w1-eeprom";
	}

Example with parent bus:

onewire_tm: onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio_a 8>;

		eeprom1: eeprom@0 {
			compatible = "sandbox,w1-eeprom";
		}
};

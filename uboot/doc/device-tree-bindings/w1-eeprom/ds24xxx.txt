Maxim DS24 families driver device binding - one wire protocol EEPROMS from Maxim
=======================

This memory needs to be connected to a onewire bus, as a child node.
The bus will read the device serial number and match this node with a found
device on the bus
Also check doc/device-tree-bindings/w1 for onewire bus drivers

Driver:
- drivers/w1-eeprom/ds24xxx.c

Software ds24xxx device-tree node properties:
Required:
* compatible = "maxim,ds24b33"
or
* compatible = "maxim,ds2431"
Further memories can be added.

Optional:
* none

Example:
	eeprom1: eeprom@0 {
		compatible = "maxim,ds24xxx";
	}

Example with parent bus:

onewire_tm: onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&pioA 32 0>;

		eeprom1: eeprom@0 {
			compatible = "maxim,ds24xxx";
		}
};

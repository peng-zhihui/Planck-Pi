	 *
	 * The boot ROM in these SoCs breaks the PARTITION_CONFIG [179] of
	 * Extended CSD register; when switching to the Boot Partition 1, the
	 * Boot ROM should issue the SWITCH command (CMD6) with Set Bits for
	 * the Access Bits, but in fact it uses Write Byte for the Access Bits.
	 * As a result, the BOOT_PARTITION_ENABLE field of the PARTITION_CONFIG
	 * is lost.  This bug was fixed for PH1-Pro5 and later SoCs.
	 *
	 * Fixup mmc->part_config here because it is used to determine the
	 * partition which the U-Boot image is read from.

	  Describes the total size of the MCU MSRAM. This doesn't

	help
	  Turn this option on to enable an early console functionality in SPL
	  before the main console is being brought up. This can be useful in
	  situations where the main console is dependent on System Firmware
	  (SYSFW) being up and running, which is usually not the case during
	  the very early stages of boot. Using this early console functionality
	  will allow for an alternate serial port to be used to support things
	  like UART-based boot and early diagnostic messages until the main
	  console is ready to get activated.

	  Amount of memory (in bytes) reserved through dynamic allocation at

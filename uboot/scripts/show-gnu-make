# Show the command name for GNU Make

# U-Boot is supposed to be built on various platforms.
# One problem is that the command 'make' is not always GNU Make.
# (For ex. the command name for GNU Make on FreeBSD is usually 'gmake'.)
# It is not a good idea to hard-code the command name in scripts
# where where GNU Make is expected.
# Call this helper script to get the command name for GNU Make.

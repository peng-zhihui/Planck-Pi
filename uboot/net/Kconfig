menuconfig NET
	bool "Networking support"
	default y

if NET

config NET_RANDOM_ETHADDR
	bool "Random ethaddr if unset"
	help
	  Selecting this will allow the Ethernet interface to function
	  even when the ethaddr variable for that interface is unset.
	  A new MAC address will be generated on every boot and it will
	  not be added to the environment.

config NETCONSOLE
	bool "NetConsole support"
	help
	  Support the 'nc' input/output device for networked console.
	  See README.NetConsole for details.

config IP_DEFRAG
	bool "Support IP datagram reassembly"
	default n
	help
	  Selecting this will enable IP datagram reassembly according
	  to the algorithm in RFC815.

config NET_MAXDEFRAG
	int "Size of buffer used for IP datagram reassembly"
	depends on IP_DEFRAG
	default 16384
	range 1024 65536
	help
	  This defines the size of the statically allocated buffer
	  used for reassembly, and thus an upper bound for the size of
	  IP datagrams that can be received.

config TFTP_BLOCKSIZE
	int "TFTP block size"
	default 1468
	help
	  Default TFTP block size.
	  The MTU is typically 1500 for ethernet, so a TFTP block of
	  1468 (MTU minus eth.hdrs) provides a good throughput with
	  almost-MTU block sizes.
	  You can also activate CONFIG_IP_DEFRAG to set a larger block.

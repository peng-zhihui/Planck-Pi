MikroTik CRS3XX-98DX3236
========================

CRS3XX-98DX3236 is a U-Boot port that supports a series of MikroTik switches
based on the Marvell Prestera 98DX3236 switch with an integrated CPU.

Common specifications:
 - Marvell Prestera 98DX3236 switch with an integrated ARMv7 CPU
 - 512 MB DDR3 RAM
 - UART @ 115200bps
 - 16 MB SPI flash (Winbond 25Q128JVSM)

Currently supported hardware:
 - UART boot (using kwboot) and console
 - SPI boot, environment and load kernel

Planned:
 - Gigabit Ethernet support (internal CPU <-> switch fabric connection)

Getting binary.0
================
binary.0 (DDR3 init phase) can be retrieved/extracted from the integrated bootloader on the SPI flash.
Then binary.0 can be replaced with the extracted blob.

How to use U-Boot on Grinn's chiliBoard
--------------------------------------

- Build U-Boot for chiliBoard:

$ make mrproper
$ make chiliboard_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the SPL image called MLO and the u-boot.img.

- Flash the SPL image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=MLO of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=128k; sync

- Flash the u-boot.img image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=128k seek=3; sync

- Jumper settings:

S2: 1 1 1 0 1 0

where 0 means bottom position and 1 means top position (from the
switch label numbers reference).

- Insert the micro SD card in the board.

- Connect USB cable between chiliBoard and the PC for the power and console.

- U-Boot messages should come up.

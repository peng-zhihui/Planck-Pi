	  This target is used for running U-Boot on top of coreboot. In
	  this case coreboot does the early inititalisation, and U-Boot
	  takes over once the RAM, video and CPU are fully running.
	  U-Boot is loaded as a fallback payload from coreboot, in
	  coreboot terminology. This method was used for the Chromebook
	  Pixel when launched.

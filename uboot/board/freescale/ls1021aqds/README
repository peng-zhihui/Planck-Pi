The LS1021AQDS is a Freescale reference board that hosts the LS1021A SoC.

LS1021A SoC Overview
------------------
The QorIQ LS1 family, which includes the LS1021A communications processor,
is built on Layerscape architecture, the industry's first software-aware,
core-agnostic networking architecture to offer unprecedented efficiency
and scale.

A member of the value-performance tier, the QorIQ LS1021A processor provides
extensive integration and power efficiency for fanless, small form factor
enterprise networking applications. Incorporating dual ARM Cortex-A7 cores
running up to 1.0 GHz, the LS1021A processor delivers pre-silicon CoreMark
performance of over 6,000, as well as virtualization support, advanced
security features and the broadest array of high-speed interconnects and
optimized peripheral features ever offered in a sub-3 W processor.

The QorIQ LS1021A processor features an integrated LCD controller,
CAN controller for implementing industrial protocols, DDR3L/4 running
up to 1600 MHz, integrated security engine and QUICC Engine, and ECC
protection on both L1 and L2 caches. The LS1021A processor is pin- and
software-compatible with the QorIQ LS1020A and LS1022A processors.

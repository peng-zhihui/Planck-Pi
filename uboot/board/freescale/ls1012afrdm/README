Overview
--------
QorIQ LS1012A FREEDOM (LS1012AFRDM) is a high-performance development
platform, with a complete debugging environment. The LS1012AFRDM board
supports the QorIQ LS1012A processor and is optimized to support the
high-bandwidth DDR3L memory and a full complement of high-speed SerDes ports.

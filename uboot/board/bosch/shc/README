Summary
=======

This document covers various features of the 'am335x_shc' build.

Hardware
========

AM335X based board:

I2C:   ready
DRAM:  512 MiB
Enabling the D-Cache
MMC:   OMAP SD/MMC: 0 @ 26 MHz, OMAP SD/MMC: 1 @ 26 MHz
Net:   cpsw

Following boot options are possible:

2 Jumpers:

Jumper 1 Jumper 2 Bootmode
off      off    eMMC boot
on       off    SD boot
off      on     Net boot

Compiling
=========

$ make am335x_shc_defconfig
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.lex.c
  SHIPPED scripts/kconfig/zconf.hash.c
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.o
  HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/conf
#
# configuration written to .config
#
$ make -s all

-> now you have the MLO and the u-boot.img file, you can put
on your SD card or eMMC.

Configuring
===========

There are a lot of board versions and boot configurations, which
can be selected through "make menuconfig"

ARM architecture  --->
  enable different boot versions for the shc board (enable eMMC)  --->
   (X) enable eMMC
   ( ) enable ICT
   ( ) enable NETBOOT
   ( ) enable SDBOOT

  enable different board versions for the shc board (C3 Sample board version)  --->
   ( ) B Sample board version
   ( ) B2 Sample board version
   ( ) C Sample board version
   ( ) C2 Sample board version
   (X) C3 Sample board version
   ( ) Series board version

Netboot
=======
- see also doc/SPL/README.am335x-network

- set the jumper into netboot mode
- compile the U-boot sources with:
  make am335x_shc_netboot_defconfig
  make all
- copy the images into your tftp boot directory
  cp spl/u-boot-spl.bin /tftpboot/.../u-boot-spl-restore.bin
  cp u-boot.img /tftpboot/.../u-boot-restore.img
- power on the board, and you should get something like this:

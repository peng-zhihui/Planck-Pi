Summary
=======

The source for omap3logic.c encompases the OMAP35 and DM3730 SOM-LV and DM3730 Torpedo platforms, but there are device trees custom taylored to each board.

omap3_logic_defconfig = DM37 Torpedo / Torpedo + Wireless
omap35_logic_defconfig = OMAP35 Torpedo
omap3_logic_somlv_defconfig = DM37 SOM-LV
omap35_logic_somlv_defconfig = OMAP35 SOM-LV

The device tree included with each of the defconfig files will also direct the board as to which dtb file to load when loading the kernel, so it is not
recomended to mix and match the defconfig files.

Falcon Mode: FAT SD cards
=========================

In this case the additional file is written to the filesystem.  In this
example we assume that the uImage and device tree to be used are already on
the FAT filesystem (only the uImage MUST be for this to function
afterwards) along with a Falcon Mode aware MLO and the FAT partition has
already been created and marked bootable:

U-Boot # mmc rescan
# Load kernel and device tree into memory, perform export
U-Boot # fatload mmc 0 ${loadaddr} uImage
U-Boot # run loadfdt
U-Boot # setenv optargs quiet
U-Boot # run mmcargs
U-Boot # run common_bootargs
U-Boot # spl export fdt ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}

This will print a number of lines and then end with something like:
   Loading Device Tree to 8dec9000, end 8dee0295 ... OK

So then note the starting address and write the args to mmc/sd:

U-Boot # fatwrite mmc 0:1 0x8dec9000 args 0x20000

The size of 0x20000 matches the CMD_SPL_WRITE_SIZE.

Falcon Mode: NAND
=================

In this case the additional data is written to another partition of the
NAND.  In this example we assume that the uImage and device tree to be are
already located on the NAND somewhere (such as filesystem or mtd partition)
along with a Falcon Mode aware MLO written to the correct locations for
booting and mtdparts have been configured correctly for the board:

U-Boot # nand read ${loadaddr} kernel
U-Boot # load nand rootfs ${fdtaddr} /boot/am335x-evm.dtb
U-Boot # run nandargs
U-Boot # run common_bootargs
U-Boot # spl export fdt ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}
U-Boot # nand erase.part u-boot-spl-os
U-Boot # nand write ${fdtaddr} u-boot-spl-os

	  This is the DFI Q7X-151 baseboard equipped with the

	  Ethernet (in non-PCIe-x4 configuration), micro-SD, USB 2,
	  USB 3, SATA, serial console and DisplayPort video out.
	  It requires some binary blobs - see README.x86 for details.

	  Note that PCIE_ECAM_BASE is set up by the FSP so the value used
	  by U-Boot matches that value.

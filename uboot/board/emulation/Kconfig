	  This is the QEMU emulated x86 board. U-Boot supports running
	  as a coreboot payload as well as bare boot without coreboot.
	  There are two types of x86 boards supported by QEMU which are
	  supported by U-Boot. They are via QEMU '-M pc', an i440FX/PIIX
	  chipset platform and '-M q35', a Q35/ICH9 chipset platform.

	help
	  This is the QEMU emulated x86 64-bit board. With this config
	  U-Boot is built as a 64-bit binary. This allows testing while
	  this feature is being completed.

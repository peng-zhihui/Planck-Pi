    This file contains a binary blob which is used on some devices to set up
    SDRAM. U-Boot executes this code in SPL so that it can make full use of
    memory. Documentation is typically not available in sufficient detail to
    allow U-Boot do this this itself..

    An example filename is 'fsp_m.bin'

    See README.x86 for information about x86 binary blobs.

    This is similar to u_boot_spl except that padding is added after the SPL
    binary to cover the BSS (Block Started by Symbol) region. This region holds
    the various used by SPL. It is set to 0 by SPL when it starts up. If you
    want to append data to the SPL image (such as a device tree file), you must
    pad out the BSS region to avoid the data overlapping with U-Boot variables.
    This entry is useful in that case. It automatically pads out the entry size
    to cover both the code, data and BSS.

    The ELF file 'spl/u-boot-spl' must also be available for this to work, since
    binman uses that to look up the BSS address.

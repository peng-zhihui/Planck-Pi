        - filename: Filename of file to read into entry

    This file contains code used by the SoC that is required to make it work.
    The Management Engine is like a background task that runs things that are
    not clearly documented, but may include keyboard, deplay and network
    access. For platform that use ME it is not possible to disable it. U-Boot
    does not directly execute code in the ME binary.

    A typical filename is 'me.bin'.

    The position of this entry is generally set by the intel-descriptor entry.

    See README.x86 for information about x86 binary blobs.

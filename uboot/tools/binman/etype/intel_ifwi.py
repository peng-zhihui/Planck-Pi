    """Entry containing an Intel Integrated Firmware Image (IFWI) file

    Properties / Entry arguments:
        - filename: Filename of file to read into entry. This is either the
            IFWI file itself, or a file that can be converted into one using a
            tool
        - convert-fit: If present this indicates that the ifwitool should be
            used to convert the provided file into a IFWI.

    This file contains code and data used by the SoC that is required to make
    it work. It includes U-Boot TPL, microcode, things related to the CSE
    (Converged Security Engine, the microcontroller that loads all the firmware)
    and other items beyond the wit of man.

    A typical filename is 'ifwi.bin' for an IFWI file, or 'fitimage.bin' for a
    file that will be converted to an IFWI.

    The position of this entry is generally set by the intel-descriptor entry.

    The contents of the IFWI are specified by the subnodes of the IFWI node.
    Each subnode describes an entry which is placed into the IFWFI with a given
    sub-partition (and optional entry name).

    Properties for subnodes:
        ifwi-subpart - sub-parition to put this entry into, e.g. "IBBP"
        ifwi-entry - entry name t use, e.g. "IBBL"
        ifwi-replace - if present, indicates that the item should be replaced
            in the IFWI. Otherwise it is added.

    See README.x86 for information about x86 binary blobs.

    This file contains a binary blob which is used on some devices to set up
    the silicon. U-Boot executes this code in U-Boot proper after SDRAM is
    running, so that it can make full use of memory. Documentation is typically
    not available in sufficient detail to allow U-Boot do this this itself.

    An example filename is 'fsp_s.bin'

    See README.x86 for information about x86 binary blobs.

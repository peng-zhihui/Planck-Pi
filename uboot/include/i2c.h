 * @flags:	Flags for this chip (dm_i2c_chip_flags)
 * @chip_addr_offset_mask: Mask of offset bits within chip_addr. Used for
 *			   devices which steal addresses as part of offset.
 *			   If offset_len is zero, then the offset is encoded
 *			   completely within the chip address itself.
 *			   e.g. a devce with chip address of 0x2c with 512
 *			   registers might use the bottom bit of the address
 *			   to indicate which half of the address space is being
 *			   accessed while still only using 1 byte offset.
 *			   This means it will respond to  chip address 0x2c and
 *			   0x2d.
 *			   A real world example is the Atmel AT24C04. It's

 *
 * kernel_addr_r must be within the first 128M of RAM in order for the
 *   kernel's CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR option to work. Since the kernel will
 *   decompress itself to 0x8000 after the start of RAM, kernel_addr_r
 *   should not overlap that area, or the kernel will have to copy itself
 *   somewhere else before decompression. Similarly, the address of any other
 *   data passed to the kernel shouldn't overlap the start of RAM. Pushing
 *   this up to 16M allows for a sizable kernel to be decompressed below the
 *   compressed load address.
 *
 * fdt_addr_r simply shouldn't overlap anything else. Choosing 32M allows for
 *   the compressed kernel to be up to 16M too.
 *
 * ramdisk_addr_r simply shouldn't overlap anything else. Choosing 33M allows
 *   for the FDT/DTB to be up to 1M, which is hopefully plenty.

Between architectures, the compiled magic at /usr/lib/file/magic.mgc
differs only in the endianness. The libmagic library can auto-detect
wrong endianness and handle that situation gracefully, at a significant
performance cost though.

Therefore: If you run file/libmagic in a mixed-endianness multi-arch
setup, choose the architecture for libmagic-mgc wisely.

The sudo philosophy
===================
Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges
to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few
privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

Where to find sudo
==================
Before you try and build sudo, *please* make sure you have the current
version.  The latest sudo may always be gotten via anonymous ftp from
ftp.sudo.ws in the directory /pub/sudo/ or from the sudo web site,
https://www.sudo.ws/

The distribution is sudo-M.m.tar.gz where `M' is the major version
number and `m' is the minor version number.  BETA versions of sudo may
also be available.  If you join the `sudo-workers' mailing list you
will get the BETA announcements (see the `Mailing lists' section below).

See the NEWS file for a list of major changes in this release.

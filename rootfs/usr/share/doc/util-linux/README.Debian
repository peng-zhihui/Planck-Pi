Periodic fstrim for SSD disks
-----------------------------

fstrim(8) is used on a mounted filesystem to discard blocks which are not in
use by the filesystem. This is useful in particular for solid-state drives
(SSDs).

A systemd service and matching timer is available to periodically perform
fstrim on relevant filesystems, but is *not* enabled by default. To enable it
according to the default weekly cadence, just do the following as root:

    systemctl enable fstrim.timer

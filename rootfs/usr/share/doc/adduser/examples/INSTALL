Please read the README file for detailed information about what needs to
be done to install the ADDUSER Local System Additions program.  In brief:

# cp --pr=t ./adduser.local /usr/local/sbin
# chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/adduser.local
# cp ./adduser.local.conf /etc
# editor /etc/adduser.local.conf         # The important step!
# mkdir /etc/skel.other
# cp --pr=t ./adduser.local.conf.examples/skel.other/index.html /etc/skel.other

IMPORTANT: Do NOT just perform the above steps without knowing what you
are doing!  In particular, the fourth step is very important for you to
do correctly.

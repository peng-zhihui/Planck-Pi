- If you want to view Chinese text and see garbage on the screen, you can try
  to set the environment variable "LESSCHARSET" to "utf-8" before running
  less, e.g. "export LESSCHARSET=utf-8" or "setenv LESSCHARSET utf8" for
  c-shells.
 
- When an editor is invoked, the default for Debian's less is to fall back
  to "/usr/bin/editor" if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined in the
  environment.

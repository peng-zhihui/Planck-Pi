License: Vim
 I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
     that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
     unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
     include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
     that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
     examples and Vim scripts.
 .
 II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
     including executables and/or source code, when the following four
     conditions are met:
     1) This license text must be included unmodified.
     2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
        a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
           the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
           (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
           must make your changes, including source code, available to the
           maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
           include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
           maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
           will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
           then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
           The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this
           changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
           vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
           impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
           your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
           received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
        b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
           mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
           unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
           text under a) applies to those changes.
        c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
           the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
           context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
           add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
           making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
        d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
           under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
           changes if the following three conditions are met:
           - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
             the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
             permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
             version of Vim without fee or restriction.
           - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
             distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
             or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
             any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
             available to him.
           - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
             contact information must remain valid for at least three years
             after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
             as possible.
        e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
           you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
           any later version.
     3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
        command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
        is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
        under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
        not conflict with the license used for the changes.
     4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
        removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
        corrections.
 .
 III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
      the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
      maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
      by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
      If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
      context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
      <maintainer@vim.org>
 .
 IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
      sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
      license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
      with, at your option.

License: OPL-1+
 I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS
 .
 The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in
 part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this
 license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by
 reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is
 displayed in the reproduction.
 .
 Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:
 .
     Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be
     distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open
     Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently
     available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).
 .
 The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the
 author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).
 .
 Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.
 .
 Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the
 original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on
 all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original
 publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as
 possessive with respect to the title.
 .
 .
 II. COPYRIGHT
 .
 The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.
 .
 .
 III. SCOPE OF LICENSE
 .
 The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless
 otherwise explicitly stated in the document.
 .
 Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication
 work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this
 license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a
 notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and
 appropriate copyright notice.
 .
 SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any
 jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.
 .
 NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is" without
 warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the
 implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a
 warranty of non-infringement.
 .
 .
 IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS
 .
 All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
 translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the
 following requirements:
 .
    1. The modified version must be labeled as such.
    2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the
       modifications dated.
    3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must
       be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
    4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.
    5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or
       imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's
       (or authors') permission.
 .
 .
 V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS
 .
 In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and
 strongly recommended of redistributors that:
 .
    1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you
       provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute
       at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the
       authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should
       describe modifications, if any, made to the document.
    2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly
       marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the
       document.
    3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered
       good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of
       an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).
 .
 .
 VI. LICENSE OPTIONS
 .
 The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may
 elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the
 license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be
 included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.
 .
 A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the
 explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive modification" is defined as
 a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in
 format or typographical corrections.
 .
 To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified
 versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the
 copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.
 .
 B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in
 part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is prohibited unless
 prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.
 .
 To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of
 the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior
 permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or
 copy.

Version 1.2
===========

Thanks for help with beta test to Bill Davidsen, Tom Dickey, Ed
Ferguson, Jack Fitts, Onno van der Linden, Carl Mascott, Jean-Pierre
Radley, John Roll, Ian Searle, Bob Stockler.

The calendar program examples/hical was written by Bob Stockler.

Darrel Hankerson ported versions 1.2.x to DOS/OS2.

Version 1.0 and 1.1
===================

Carl Mascott ported mawk to V7 and in the process rooted out
some subtle (and not so subtle) bugs.

Ian Searle ported mawk to System V and put up with my insane
attempts to get fpe exception trapping off.

An anonymous reviewer for comp.sources.reviewed did the
MSC and Mac ports and wrote .bat files for the tests.
Another or maybe the same reviewer did the Dynix port.

	Ed Ferguson		MIPS M2000 C2.20 OS4.52
	Jwahar R. Bammi		Atari ST
	Berry Kercheval		SGI IRIX 4.0.1
	Andy Newman		Next 2.1
	Mike Carlton		Next 2.1

The DOS version is a lot better thanks to suggestions and testing
from Ed Ferguson, Jack Fitts, Nadav Horesh, Michael Golan and
Conny Ohstrom. The DOS additions for 1.1.2d are all ideas of
Ben Myers; much of the code is his too.

Arnold Robbins kept me current on POSIX standards for AWK, and
explained some of the "dark corners".

Thank you to everyone who reported bugs or offered encouragement,
suggestions or criticism. (At least the bugs got fixed).

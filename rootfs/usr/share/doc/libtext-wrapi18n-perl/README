Text::WrapI18N version 0.06
===========================

This is a module which intends to substitute Text::Wrap,
which supports internationalized texts including:
 - multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5,
 - fullwidth characters like east Asian characters which appear in
   UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, Big5, and so on,
 - combining characters like diacritical marks which appear in UTF-8,
   ISO-8859-11 (aka TIS-620), and so on, and
 - languages which don't use whitespaces between words, like Chinese
   and Japanese.

The text is to be given in locale encoding, not always in UTF-8.
(Of course locale encoding is UTF-8 in UTF-8 locales.)

$Text::WrapI18N::columns is available like $Text::Wrap::columns.
Also, $Text::WrapI18N::separator is available.

However, $Text::WrapI18N::huge, $Text::WrapI18N::break, 
$Text::WrapI18N::tabstop, and $Text::WrapI18N::unexpand are not
available yet.

This module is originally written for "debconf", a standard configuration
system of Debian.

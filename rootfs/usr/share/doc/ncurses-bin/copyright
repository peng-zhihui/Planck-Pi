This is the Debian prepackaged version of the ncurses
library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was originally written
by Pavel Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal@netcom.com>, and is
currently held by the Free Software Foundation.

This package was put together by Vaidhyanathan G Mayilrangam
<vaidhy@debian.org> and Joel Klecker <espy@debian.org>, using sources
obtained from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.0.tar.gz.
Current versions of the ncurses sources are found at
ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/.

It is based somewhat on work done by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>,
David Engel <david@elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman
<mdorman@debian.org>, Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>, James Troup
<jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>, J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)
<jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>, and Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net>
over various years.

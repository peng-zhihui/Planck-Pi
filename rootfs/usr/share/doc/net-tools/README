                Information about the net-tools package

NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
		NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating
		system.

This package includes the important tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the Linux kernel.  This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig,
netstat, rarp and route.  Additionally, this package contains
utilities relating to particular network hardware types (plipconfig,
slattach, mii-tool) and advanced aspects of IP configuration (iptunnel,
ipmaddr).

Please include the output of "program --version" when reporting bugs.

                          Notes
                          -----

This is net-tools 1.6x.

You need kernel 2.0 or later to use these programs.  These programs
should compile cleanly with both glibc (version 2.0 or 2.1) and libc5,
though support for libc5 is not well tested.

The NLS support was changed from catgets to GNU gettext by Arnaldo
Carvalho de Melo <acme@conectiva.com.br> in June, 1998, to make the
source more readable. Translations to brazilian portuguese (pt_BR),
German (de), Estonian (ee), Czech (cz) and French (fr) are available.
Others are welcome!

route/netstat -r do not yet support different address families
cleanly.  IPX/DDP/AX25 people, please feel free to add the code.

ifconfig now supports changing media types for interfaces.  This requires
a version 2.2 kernel, and many devices do not support it yet.

The tools now support the layout of the 2.2 kernel /proc files (Bernd
Eckenfels).

Some configuration options require kernel version 2.2 and/or
particular versions of the C library.  The defaults should be safe for
all common environments but some of the more esoteric hardware and
protocol families may be more touchy.  Feel free to send patches if
you have problems.

For this release, the localized man pages are installed with UTF-8 encoding.

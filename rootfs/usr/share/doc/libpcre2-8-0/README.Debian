			   PCRE2 for Debian
			   ----------------

This is PCRE2, the newer version of the PCRE (perl-compatible regular
expression) library. New projects should use this library in
preference the older PCRE library (which is, for historical reasons,
called pcre3 in Debian).

The names of functions in libpcre2-posix are prefixed with PCRE2_, so
they don't clash with the names in libc.

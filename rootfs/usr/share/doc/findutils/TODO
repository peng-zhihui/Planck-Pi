* Internationalization
** updatedb.sh should be internationalized

* man page for frcode
Perhaps a better description in texi pages as well.

* Add option for find to sort output in lexical order for use for updatedb
olarsac@airfrance.fr (Olivier) made the following suggestion:

As I was running thru the code looking for the bug I wondered why the updatedb
has to use sort...
why not add an option to find that sorts the output in lexical order?
my point is:
- sort on a big list is costly (here we do locate on big big file system)
- find may (in theory) sort incrementally very easily by sorting only the current
directory entries before recursion

* Include example of use of updatedb in documentation.
Use something close to the Debian daily cron job.

* Supply example for time range commands for find.

* Test Coverage improvements

Comment:
 The overall licence of the OpenSSH upstream code amounts to BSD-3-clause or
 various less restrictive licences, with the additional restrictions that
 derived versions must be clearly marked as such and that if derived works
 are incompatible with the RFC-specified protocol then they must be called
 by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

   As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
   can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
   software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
   incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
   called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
 .
   Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
   software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
   bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
   information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".
 .
   The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
   permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
   You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
   making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in

USB ID's database
=================

usbutils now use the udev's hardware database to associate a full
human-readable name to the vendor ID and the product ID. If your device
is not or wrongly recognized by lsusb, please fill a bug against the
udev package and not against usbutils nor usb.ids.

usbutils depends on usb.ids to  provides /usr/share/misc/usb.ids for
packages that needs it, but it does not use this file. The dependency
will eventually get removed.

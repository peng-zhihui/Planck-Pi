Please consider registering MIME media types to the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) before requiring their inclusion in /etc/mime.types.
Simplified registration procedures for vendor and personal trees are being
implemented with the update of RFC 4288[1], that states: "it should rarely, if
ever, be necessary to use unregistered types.  Therefore, use of types in the
'x.' tree is strongly discouraged."  I have confirmed that the process is
fairly quick and painless by registering text/vnd.debian.copyright[2] for
machine-readable Debian copyright files.

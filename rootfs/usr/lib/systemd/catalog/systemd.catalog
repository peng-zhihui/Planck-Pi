Subject: Disk space used by the journal
Defined-By: systemd
Support: https://www.debian.org/support

@JOURNAL_NAME@ (@JOURNAL_PATH@) is currently using @CURRENT_USE_PRETTY@.
Maximum allowed usage is set to @MAX_USE_PRETTY@.
Leaving at least @DISK_KEEP_FREE_PRETTY@ free (of currently available @DISK_AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ of disk space).
Enforced usage limit is thus @LIMIT_PRETTY@, of which @AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ are still available.

The limits controlling how much disk space is used by the journal may
be configured with SystemMaxUse=, SystemKeepFree=, SystemMaxFileSize=,
RuntimeMaxUse=, RuntimeKeepFree=, RuntimeMaxFileSize= settings in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf. See journald.conf(5) for details.

Documentation: man:journald.conf(5)

A service has logged too many messages within a time period. Messages

The limits controlling when messages are dropped may be configured
with RateLimitIntervalSec= and RateLimitBurst= in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf or LogRateLimitIntervalSec= and LogRateLimitBurst=
in the unit file. See journald.conf(5) and systemd.exec(5) for details.

Subject: DNSSEC mode has been turned off, as server doesn't support it
Defined-By: systemd
Support: https://www.debian.org/support
Documentation: man:systemd-resolved.service(8) resolved.conf(5)

The resolver service (systemd-resolved.service) has detected that the
configured DNS server does not support DNSSEC, and DNSSEC validation has been
turned off as result.

This event will take place if DNSSEC=allow-downgrade is configured in
resolved.conf and the configured DNS server is incompatible with DNSSEC. Note
that using this mode permits DNSSEC downgrade attacks, as an attacker might be
able turn off DNSSEC validation on the system by inserting DNS replies in the
communication channel that result in a downgrade like this.

This event might be indication that the DNS server is indeed incompatible with
DNSSEC or that an attacker has successfully managed to stage such a downgrade
attack.

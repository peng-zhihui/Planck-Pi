Description=Remove the Offline System Updates symlink

# system-update-generator uses laccess("/system-update"), while a plain
# ConditionPathExists=/system-update uses access("/system-update"), so
# we need an alternate condition to cover the case of a dangling symlink.
#
# This service is only invoked if /system-update exists, i.e. if the
# condition tested by system-update-generator remains true and the system
# would be diverted into system-update.target again after reboot. This way
# we guard against being diverted into system-update.target again, which
# works as a safety measure, but we will not step on the toes of the
# update script if it successfully removed the symlink and scheduled a
# reboot or some other action on its own.

# When bonding module is loaded, it creates bond0 by default due to max_bonds
# option default value 1. This interferes with the network configuration
# management / networkd, as it is not possible to detect whether this bond0 was
# intentionally configured by the user, or should be managed by
# networkd/NM/etc. Therefore disable bond0 creation.

options bonding max_bonds=0

# Do the same for dummy0.

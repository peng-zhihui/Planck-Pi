# Uncommenting the following three lines will polyinstantiate
# /tmp, /var/tmp and user's home directories. /tmp and /var/tmp will
# be polyinstantiated based on the MLS level part of the security context as well as user
# name, Polyinstantion will not be performed for user root and adm for directories
# /tmp and /var/tmp, whereas home directories will be polyinstantiated for all users.
# The user name and context is appended to the instance prefix.
#
# Note that instance directories do not have to reside inside the
# polyinstantiated directory. In the examples below, instances of /tmp
# will be created in /tmp-inst directory, where as instances of /var/tmp
# and users home directories will reside within the directories that
# are being polyinstantiated.
#
# Instance parent directories must exist for the polyinstantiation
# mechanism to work. By default, they should be created with the mode
# of 000. pam_namespace module will enforce this mode unless it
# is explicitly called with an argument to ignore the mode of the
# instance parent. System administrators should use this argument with
# caution, as it will reduce security and isolation achieved by
# polyinstantiation.

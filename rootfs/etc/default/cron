# Cron configuration options

# Whether to read the system's default environment files (if present)
# If set to "yes", cron will set a proper mail charset from the
# locale information. If set to something other than 'yes', the default
# charset 'C' (canonical name: ANSI_X3.4-1968) will be used.
#
# This has no effect on tasks running under cron; their environment can
# only be changed via PAM or from within the crontab; see crontab(5).
READ_ENV="yes"

# Extra options for cron, see cron(8)
#
# For example, to enable LSB name support in /etc/cron.d/, use
# EXTRA_OPTS='-l'  
#
# Or, to log standard messages, plus jobs with exit status != 0:
# EXTRA_OPTS='-L 5'
#
# For quick reference, the currently available log levels are:
#   0   no logging (errors are logged regardless)
#   1   log start of jobs
#   2   log end of jobs
#   4   log jobs with exit status != 0
#   8   log the process identifier of child process (in all logs)
#
#EXTRA_OPTS=""

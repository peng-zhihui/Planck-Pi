# The purpose of this script is just to show the variables that are
# available to all the scripts in this directory. All these scripts are
# called from dhclient-script, which exports all the variables shown
# before. If you want to debug a problem with your DHCP setup you can
# enable this script and take a look at /tmp/dhclient-script.debug.

# To enable this script set the following variable to "yes"
RUN="no"

 * struct bloblist_hdr - header for the bloblist

 * boundary. Records follow this header. The bloblist normally stays in the
 * same place in memory as SPL and U-Boot execute, but it can be safely moved
 * around.
 *
 * None of the bloblist structures contain pointers but it is possible to put
 * pointers inside a bloblist record if desired. This is not encouraged,
 * since it can make part of the bloblist inaccessible if the pointer is
 * no-longer valid. It is better to just store all the data inside a bloblist
 * record.
 *
 * Each bloblist record is aligned to a 16-byte boundary and follows immediately
 * from the last.
 *
 * @version: BLOBLIST_VERSION
 * @hdr_size: Size of this header, normally sizeof(struct bloblist_hdr). The
 *	first bloblist_rec starts at this offset from the start of the header
 * @flags: Space for BLOBLISTF_... flags (none yet)
 * @magic: BLOBLIST_MAGIC
 * @size: Total size of all records (non-zero if valid) including this header.
 *	The bloblist extends for this many bytes from the start of this header.
 * @alloced: Total size allocated for this bloblist. When adding new records,
 *	the bloblist can grow up to this size. This starts out as
 *	sizeof(bloblist_hdr) since we need at least that much space to store a
 *	valid bloblist
 * @spare: Space space
 * @chksum: CRC32 for the entire bloblist allocated area. Since any of the
 *	blobs can be altered after being created, this checksum is only valid
 *	when the bloblist is finalised before jumping to the next stage of boot.
 *	Note: @chksum is last to make it easier to exclude it from the checksum
 *	calculation.

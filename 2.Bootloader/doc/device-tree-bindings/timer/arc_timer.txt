ARC Timer

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "snps,arc-timer".
- reg : Specifies timer ID, could be either 0 or 1.
- clocks : Specifies clocks that drives the counter.

Examples:

timer@0 {
	compatible = "snps,arc-timer";
	clocks = <&core_clk>;
	reg = <0>;
};

timer@1 {
	compatible = "snps,arc-timer";
	clocks = <&core_clk>;
	reg = <1>;
};

NOTE: if you specify both timers, clocks always should be the same
as each timer is driven by the same core clock.

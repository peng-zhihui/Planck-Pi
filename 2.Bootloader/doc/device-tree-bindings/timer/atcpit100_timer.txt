Andestech ATCPIT100 timer
------------------------------------------------------------------
ATCPIT100 is a generic IP block from Andes Technology, embedded in
Andestech AE3XX, AE250 platforms and other designs.

This timer is a set of compact multi-function timers, which can be
used as pulse width modulators (PWM) as well as simple timers.

It supports up to 4 PIT channels. Each PIT channel is a
multi-function timer and provide the following usage scenarios:
One 32-bit timer
Two 16-bit timers
Four 8-bit timers
One 16-bit PWM
One 16-bit timer and one 8-bit PWM
Two 8-bit timer and one 8-bit PWM

Required properties:
- compatible	: Should be "andestech,atcpit100"
- reg		: Address and length of the register set
- interrupts	: Reference to the timer interrupt
- clock-frequency : The rate in HZ in input of the Andestech ATCPIT100 timer

Examples:

timer0: timer@f0400000 {
	compatible = "andestech,atcpit100";
	reg = <0xf0400000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <2 4>;
	clock-frequency = <30000000>;

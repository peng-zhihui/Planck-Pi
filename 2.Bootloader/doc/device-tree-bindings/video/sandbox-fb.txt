Sandbox LCD
===========

This uses the displaymode.txt binding except that only xres and yres are
required properties. Also an additional optional property is defined:

log2-depth: Log base 2 of the U-Boot display buffer depth (4=16bpp, 5=32bpp).
	If not provided, a value of 4 is used.

Example:

	lcd {
		compatible = "sandbox,lcd-sdl";
		xres = <800>;
		yres = <600>;
		log2-depth = <5>;
	};

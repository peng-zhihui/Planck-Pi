Intel GMA Bindings
==================

This is the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator. This binding supports selection
of display parameters only.


Required properties:
 - compatible : "intel,gma";

Optional properties:
 - intel,dp-hotplug : values for digital port hotplug, one cell per value for
     ports B, C and D
  - intel,panel-port-select : output port to use: 0=LVDS 1=DP_B 2=DP_C 3=DP_D
  - intel,panel-power-cycle-delay : T4 time sequence (6 = 500ms)

  The following delays are in units of 0.1ms:
  - intel,panel-power-up-delay : T1+T2 time sequence
  - intel,panel-power-down-delay : T3 time sequence
  - intel,panel-power-backlight-on-delay : T5 time sequence
  - intel,panel-power-backlight-off-delay : Tx time sequence

  - intel,cpu-backlight : Value for CPU Backlight PWM
  - intel,pch-backlight : Value for PCH Backlight PWM

Example
-------

gma {
	compatible = "intel,gma";
	intel,dp_hotplug = <0 0 0x06>;
	intel,panel-port-select = <1>;
	intel,panel-power-cycle-delay = <6>;
	intel,panel-power-up-delay = <2000>;
	intel,panel-power-down-delay = <500>;
	intel,panel-power-backlight-on-delay = <2000>;
	intel,panel-power-backlight-off-delay = <2000>;
	intel,cpu-backlight = <0x00000200>;
	intel,pch-backlight = <0x04000000>;
};

Rockchip LVDS interface
------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
	of memory mapped region.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	clock-names property.
- clock-names: must contain "pclk_lvds"

- rockchip,grf: phandle to the general register files syscon

- rockchip,data-mapping: should be <LVDS_FORMAT_VESA> or  <LVDS_FORMAT_JEIDA>,
	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
	serialized LVDS signal.
- rockchip,data-width : should be <18> or <24>;
- rockchip,output: should be <LVDS_OUTPUT_RGB>, <LVDS_OUTPUT_SINGLE> or
	<LVDS_OUTPUT_DUAL>, This describes the output face.

- display-timings : described by
	doc/device-tree-bindings/video/display-timing.txt.

	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcdc0_ctl>;
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		status = "disabled";
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			lvds_in: port@0 {

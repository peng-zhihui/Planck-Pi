PMIC ESM Binding
======================

Certain Power Management ICs contain safety handling logic within them,
allowing automatic reset of the board in case a safety error is signaled.
For this purpose, ESM (Error Signal Monitor) is implemented within
the PMIC running its own state machine.

Required properties :
- compatible	: "ti,tps659413-esm"

Example
=======

&tps659413a {
	esm: esm {
		compatible = "ti,tps659413-esm";
	};
};

* Synopsys HSDK clock generation unit

The Synopsys HSDK clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers and peripherals within the SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "snps,hsdk-cgu-clock"
- reg: the pair of physical base address and length of clock generation unit
  memory mapped region and creg arc core divider memory mapped region.
- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/snps,hsdk-cgu.h headers and can be
used in device tree sources.

Example: Clock controller node:

	cgu_clk: cgu-clk@f0000000 {
		compatible = "snps,hsdk-cgu-clock";
		reg = <0xf0000000 0x1000>, <0xf00014B8 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
controller:

	uart0: serial0@f0005000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
		reg = <0xf0005000 0x1000>;
		reg-shift = <2>;
		reg-io-width = <4>;
		clocks = <&cgu_clk CLK_SYS_UART_REF>;
	};

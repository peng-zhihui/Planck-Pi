    This file contains binary blobs which are used on some devices to make the
    platform work. U-Boot executes this code since it is not possible to set up
    the hardware using U-Boot open-source code. Documentation is typically not
    available in sufficient detail to allow this.

    An example filename is 'FSP/QUEENSBAY_FSP_GOLD_001_20-DECEMBER-2013.fd'

    See README.x86 for information about x86 binary blobs.

WARNING:
--------
This file should contain the bin_hdr generated by the original Marvell
U-Boot implementation. As this is currently not included in this
U-Boot version, we have added this placeholder, so that the U-Boot
image can be generated without errors.

If you have a known to be working bin_hdr for your board, then you
just need to replace this text file here with the binary header
and recompile U-Boot.

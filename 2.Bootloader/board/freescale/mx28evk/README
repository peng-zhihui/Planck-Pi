FREESCALE MX28EVK
==================

Supported hardware: MX28EVK rev C and D are supported in U-Boot.

Jumper configuration
---------------------

To boot MX28EVK from an SD card, set the boot mode DIP switches as:

   * Boot Mode Select: 1 0 0 1 (Boot from SD card Slot 0 - U42)
   * JTAG PSWITCH RESET: To the right (reset disabled)
   * Battery Source: Down
   * Wall 5V: Up
   * VDD 5V: To the left (off)
   * Hold Button: Down (off)

To boot MX28EVK from SPI NOR flash, set the boot mode DIP switches as:

   * Boot Mode Select: 0 0 1 0 (Boot from SSP2)
   * JTAG PSWITCH RESET: To the right (reset disabled)
   * Battery Source: Down
   * Wall 5V: Up
   * VDD 5V: To the left (off)
   * Hold Button: Down (off)

Environment Storage
-------------------

There are three targets for mx28evk:

"make mx28evk_config"		- store environment variables into MMC

or

"make mx28evk_nand_config"	- store environment variables into NAND flash

or

"make mx28evk_spi_config"       - store environment variables into SPI NOR flash

Choose the target accordingly.

Note: The mx28evk board does not come with a NAND flash populated from the
factory. It comes with an empty slot (U23), which allows the insertion of a
48-pin TSOP flash device.

mx28evk does not come with SPI NOR flash populated from the factory either.
It is possible to solder a SOIC memory on U49 or use a DIP8 on J89.
To get SPI communication to work R320, R321,R322 and C178 need to be populated.
Look in the schematics for the proper component values.

Follow the instructions from doc/imx/common/mxs.txt to generate a bootable
SD card or to generate a binary to be flashed into SPI NOR.
